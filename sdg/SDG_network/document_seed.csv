The following information is substitute information provided in accordance with General Instruction J to Form 10-K:
Item 1112(b) of Regulation AB. Significant Obligor Financial Information
No single obligor represents more than 10% of the pool assets held by the Issuing Entity.
Items 1114(b)(2) of Regulation AB. Credit Enhancement and Other Support, Except for Certain Derivatives

Items 1115(b) of Regulation AB. Credit Derivatives Instruments

Item 1117 of Regulation AB. Legal Proceedings
Other than as stated in the following paragraphs, no legal proceedings are pending against the Issuing Entity, Navient Solutions, LLC (formerly, Navient Solutions, Inc.), as the Sponsor, the Servicer and the Administrator, Navient Funding, LLC, as the Depositor (the “Depositor”) and registrant under Registration Statement Number 333-190926 (the “Registrant”) or to the Registrant’s knowledge, Deutsche Bank National Trust Company, as the Indenture Trustee, or Nelnet Servicing, LLC, as successor Subservicer to Great Lakes Educational Loan Services, Inc., that are or would be material to the holders of the notes issued by the Issuing Entity, nor does the Registrant know of any such proceeding contemplated by any governmental authorities.
The following three paragraphs are disclosure received from Navient Solutions, LLC (formerly, Navient Solutions, Inc.) (“Navient Solutions”), the servicer for this transaction.
In January 2017, the CFPB and the Offices of the Attorneys General for the State of Illinois and the State of Washington initiated civil actions naming Navient Corporation (“Navient”) and several of its subsidiaries (including Navient Solutions) as defendants alleging violations of certain federal and state consumer protection statutes, including the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (“CFPA”), the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and various state consumer protection laws. In October 2017, the Attorney General for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania initiated a civil action against Navient and Navient Solutions, containing similar alleged violations of the CFPA and the Pennsylvania Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Law. Additionally, the Attorneys General for the States of California, Mississippi and New Jersey have initiated similar actions against Navient and certain subsidiaries alleging violations of various state and federal consumer protection laws. We refer to the Illinois, Washington, Pennsylvania, California, Mississippi, and New Jersey Attorneys General collectively as the “State Attorneys General.” In addition to these matters, a number of lawsuits have been filed by nongovernmental parties or, in the future, may be filed by additional governmental or nongovernmental parties seeking damages or other remedies related to similar issues raised by the CFPB and the State Attorneys General. As Navient has previously stated, we believe the suits improperly seek to impose penalties on Navient based on new, unannounced servicing standards applied retroactively only against one servicer, and that the allegations are false. We therefore have denied these allegations and intend to vigorously defend against the allegations in each of these cases.
During the first quarter of 2016, Navient, certain Navient officers and directors, and the underwriters of certain Navient securities offerings (including certain of the initial purchasers) were sued in three putative securities class action lawsuits filed on behalf of certain investors in Navient stock or Navient unsecured debt. These three cases, which were filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, were consolidated by the District Court, with Lord Abbett Funds appointed as Lead Plaintiff. The caption of the consolidated case is Lord Abbett Affiliated Fund, Inc., et al. v. Navient Corporation, et al. The plaintiffs filed their amended and consolidated complaint in September 2016. In September 2017, the Court granted the Navient defendants’ motion and dismissed the complaint in its entirety with leave to amend. The plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint with the court in November 2017 and the Navient defendants filed a motion to dismiss the second amended complaint in January 2018. In January 2019, the Court granted-in-part and denied-in-part the Navient defendants’ motion to dismiss. The Navient defendants deny the allegations and intend to vigorously defend against the allegations in this lawsuit. Discovery is on-going. Additionally, two putative class actions have been filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey captioned Eli Pope v. Navient Corporation, John F. Remondi, Somsak Chivavibul and Christian Lown, and Melvin Gross v. Navient Corporation, John F. Remondi, Somsak Chivavibul and Christian M. Lown, both of which allege violations of the federal securities laws under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). After the cases were consolidated by the Court in February 2018 under the caption In RE Navient Corporation Securities Litigation, the plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint in April 2018 and Navient Corporation filed a motion to dismiss in June 2018. In December 2019, the Court denied Navient’s motion to dismiss and discovery is on-going. Navient continues to deny the allegations and intends to vigorously defend itself.
At this point in time, Navient is unable to anticipate the timing of a resolution or the impact that these legal proceedings may have on Navient’s consolidated financial position, liquidity, results of operation or cash flows. As a result, it is not possible at this time to estimate a range of potential exposure, if any, for amounts that may be payable in connection with these matters and reserves have not been established. It is possible that an adverse ruling or rulings may have a material adverse impact on Navient, Navient Solutions and/or their affiliates or on the financial ability of the depositor, the servicer or a seller to fulfill an obligation to purchase or repurchase trust student loans in connection with a breach of representation, warranty or covenant. It is also possible that an adverse ruling or rulings on claims made by the CFPB and State Attorneys General in their complaints against Navient or its affiliates may have a material adverse effect on the trust student loans. In either case, the payments on your notes may be adversely affected.
The following two paragraphs are disclosure received from Deutsche Bank National Trust Company and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas. Deutsche Bank National Trust Company (“DBNTC”) and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (“DBTCA”) have been sued by investors in civil litigation concerning their role as trustees of certain residential mortgage backed securities (“RMBS”) trusts.
On December 30, 2015, IKB International, S.A. in Liquidation and IKB Deutsche Industriebank A.G. (collectively, “IKB”), as an investor in 37 RMBS trusts, filed a summons with notice in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County, against DBNTC and DBTCA as trustees of the trusts. On May 27, 2016, IKB served its complaint asserting claims for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of duty to avoid conflicts of interest, violation of the Streit Act, violation of the TIA, violation of Regulation AB, and violation of Section 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code. IKB alleges that DBNTC and DBTCA are liable for over U.S. $268 million in damages. On October 5, 2016, DBNTC and DBTCA, together with several other trustees defending lawsuits by IKB, filed a joint motion to dismiss. On January 6, 2017, IKB filed a notice of discontinuance, voluntarily dismissing with prejudice all claims as to three trusts. On June 20, 2017, the parties filed a stipulation, voluntarily dismissing with prejudice all claims as to four additional trusts. On January 27, 2021, the court granted in part and denied in part DBNTC and DBTCA’s motion to dismiss. The court granted the motion to dismiss with respect to IKB’s claims for violations of the Streit Act, Regulation AB, and Section 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code, as well as certain aspects of IKB’s claims for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, and violation of the TIA. The court denied the remainder of the motion to dismiss. IKB’s remaining claims for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of duty to avoid conflicts of interest, and violation of the TIA will proceed. Discovery is ongoing.
It is DBTCA’s and DBNTC’s belief that they have no pending legal proceedings, including, based on DBTCA’s and DBNTC’s current evaluation, the litigation disclosed in the immediately preceding paragraph that would materially affect their ability to perform their duties as Trustee under the Indenture for this transaction.

The following substitute information is provided in accordance with General Instruction J to Form 10-K:
Item 1112(b) of Regulation AB. Significant Obligors of Pool Assets.
No single obligor represents 10% or more of the asset pool owned by Toyota Auto Receivables 2018-A Owner Trust (the “Trust”).
Item 1114(b)(2) of Regulation AB. Credit Enhancement and Other Support, Except for Certain Derivatives Instruments.
No entity or group of affiliated entities provides any external credit enhancement or other support with respect to either payment on the pool assets owned by the Trust or payments on the notes (the “Notes”) or the certificate (the “Certificate”) issued by the Trust.
Item 1115(b) of Regulation AB. Certain Derivatives Instruments.
No entity or group of affiliated entities provides any external derivative instruments to either payment on the pool assets owned by the Trust or payments on the Notes or the Certificate.
Item 1117 of Regulation AB. Legal Proceedings.
The following five paragraphs are disclosures received from U.S. Bank National Association (“U.S. Bank”), which serves as the indenture trustee under the indenture for the Toyota Auto Receivables 2018-A Owner Trust transaction.
In the last several years, U.S. Bank and other large financial institutions have been sued in their capacity as trustee or successor trustee for certain residential mortgage backed securities (""RMBS"") trusts. The complaints, primarily filed by investors or investor groups against U.S. Bank and similar institutions, allege the trustees caused losses to investors as a result of alleged failures by the sponsors, mortgage loan sellers and servicers to comply with the governing agreements for these RMBS trusts. Plaintiffs generally assert causes of action based upon the trustees’ purported failures to enforce repurchase obligations of mortgage loan sellers for alleged breaches of representations and warranties, notify securityholders of purported events of default allegedly caused by breaches of servicing standards by mortgage loan servicers and abide by a heightened standard of care following alleged events of default.
U.S. Bank denies liability and believes that it has performed its obligations under the RMBS trusts in good faith, that its actions were not the cause of losses to investors, that it has meritorious defenses, and it has contested and intends to continue contesting the plaintiffs’ claims vigorously. However, U.S. Bank cannot assure you as to the outcome of any of the litigation, or the possible impact of these litigations on the trustee or the RMBS trusts.
On March 9, 2018, a law firm purporting to represent fifteen Delaware statutory trusts (the “DSTs”) that issued securities backed by student loans (the “Student Loans”) filed a lawsuit in the Delaware Court of Chancery against U.S. Bank in its capacities as indenture trustee and successor special servicer, and three other institutions in their respective transaction capacities, with respect to the DSTs and the Student Loans. This lawsuit is captioned The National Collegiate Student Loan Master Trust I, et al. v. U.S. Bank National Association, et al., C.A. No. 2018-0167-JRS (Del. Ch.) (the “NCMSLT Action”). The complaint, as amended on June 15, 2018, alleged that the DSTs have been harmed as a result of purported misconduct or omissions by the defendants concerning administration of the trusts and special servicing of the Student Loans. Since the filing of the NCMSLT Action, certain Student Loan borrowers have made assertions against U.S. Bank concerning special servicing that appear to be based on certain allegations made on behalf of the DSTs in the NCMSLT Action.
U.S. Bank has filed a motion seeking dismissal of the operative complaint in its entirety with prejudice pursuant to Chancery Court Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) or, in the alternative, a stay of the case while other prior filed disputes involving the DSTs and the Student Loans are litigated. On November 7, 2018, the Court ruled that the case should be stayed in its entirety pending resolution of the first-filed cases. On January 21, 2020, the Court entered an order consolidating for pretrial purposes the NCMSLT Action and three other lawsuits pending in the Delaware Court of Chancery concerning the DSTs and the Student Loans, which remains pending.
U.S. Bank denies liability in the NCMSLT Action and believes it has performed its obligations as indenture trustee and special servicer in good faith and in compliance in all material respects with the terms of the agreements governing the DSTs and that it has meritorious defenses. It has contested and intends to continue contesting the plaintiffs’ claims vigorously.

Item 1112(b) of Regulation AB. Significant Obligor Financial Information
No single obligor represents more than 10% of the pool assets held by the Issuing Entity.
Items 1114(b)(2) of Regulation AB. Credit Enhancement and Other Support, Except for Certain Derivatives

Items 1115(b) of Regulation AB. Credit Derivatives Instruments

Item 1117 of Regulation AB. Legal Proceedings
Other than as stated in the following paragraphs, no legal proceedings are pending against the Issuing Entity, Navient Solutions, LLC (formerly, Navient Solutions, Inc.), as the Sponsor, the Servicer and the Administrator, Navient Funding, LLC, as the Depositor (the “Depositor”) and registrant under Registration Statement Number 333-166301 (the “Registrant”) or to the Registrant’s knowledge, Deutsche Bank National Trust Company, as the Indenture Trustee, that are or would be material to the holders of the notes issued by the Issuing Entity, nor does the Registrant know of any such proceeding contemplated by any governmental authorities.
The following three paragraphs are disclosure received from Navient Solutions, LLC (formerly, Navient Solutions, Inc.) (“Navient Solutions”), the servicer for this transaction.
In January 2017, the CFPB and the Offices of the Attorneys General for the State of Illinois and the State of Washington initiated civil actions naming Navient Corporation (“Navient”) and several of its subsidiaries (including Navient Solutions) as defendants alleging violations of certain federal and state consumer protection statutes, including the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (“CFPA”), the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and various state consumer protection laws. In October 2017, the Attorney General for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania initiated a civil action against Navient and Navient Solutions, containing similar alleged violations of the CFPA and the Pennsylvania Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Law. Additionally, the Attorneys General for the States of California, Mississippi and New Jersey have initiated similar actions against Navient and certain subsidiaries alleging violations of various state and federal consumer protection laws. We refer to the Illinois, Washington, Pennsylvania, California, Mississippi, and New Jersey Attorneys General collectively as the “State Attorneys General.” In addition to these matters, a number of lawsuits have been filed by nongovernmental parties or, in the future, may be filed by additional governmental or nongovernmental parties seeking damages or other remedies related to similar issues raised by the CFPB and the State Attorneys General. As Navient has previously stated, we believe the suits improperly seek to impose penalties on Navient based on new, unannounced servicing standards applied retroactively only against one servicer, and that the allegations are false. We therefore have denied these allegations and intend to vigorously defend against the allegations in each of these cases.
During the first quarter of 2016, Navient, certain Navient officers and directors, and the underwriters of certain Navient securities offerings (including certain of the initial purchasers) were sued in three putative securities class action lawsuits filed on behalf of certain investors in Navient stock or Navient unsecured debt. These three cases, which were filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, were consolidated by the District Court, with Lord Abbett Funds appointed as Lead Plaintiff. The caption of the consolidated case is Lord Abbett Affiliated Fund, Inc., et al. v. Navient Corporation, et al. The plaintiffs filed their amended and consolidated complaint in September 2016. In September 2017, the Court granted the Navient defendants’ motion and dismissed the complaint in its entirety with leave to amend. The plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint with the court in November 2017 and the Navient defendants filed a motion to dismiss the second amended complaint in January 2018. In January 2019, the Court granted-in-part and denied-in-part the Navient defendants’ motion to dismiss. The Navient defendants deny the allegations and intend to vigorously defend against the allegations in this lawsuit. Discovery is on-going. Additionally, two putative class actions have been filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey captioned Eli Pope v. Navient Corporation, John F. Remondi, Somsak Chivavibul and Christian Lown, and Melvin Gross v. Navient Corporation, John F. Remondi, Somsak Chivavibul and Christian M. Lown, both of which allege violations of the federal securities laws under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). After the cases were consolidated by the Court in February 2018 under the caption In RE Navient Corporation Securities Litigation, the plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint in April 2018 and Navient Corporation filed a motion to dismiss in June 2018. In December 2019, the Court denied Navient’s motion to dismiss and discovery is on-going. Navient continues to deny the allegations and intends to vigorously defend itself.
At this point in time, Navient is unable to anticipate the timing of a resolution or the impact that these legal proceedings may have on Navient’s consolidated financial position, liquidity, results of operation or cash flows. As a result, it is not possible at this time to estimate a range of potential exposure, if any, for amounts that may be payable in connection with these matters and reserves have not been established. It is possible that an adverse ruling or rulings may have a material adverse impact on Navient, Navient Solutions and/or their affiliates or on the financial ability of the depositor, the servicer or a seller to fulfill an obligation to purchase or repurchase trust student loans in connection with a breach of representation, warranty or covenant. It is also possible that an adverse ruling or rulings on claims made by the CFPB and State Attorneys General in their complaints against Navient or its affiliates may have a material adverse effect on the trust student loans. In either case, the payments on your notes may be adversely affected.
The following two paragraphs are disclosure received from Deutsche Bank National Trust Company and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas. Deutsche Bank National Trust Company (“DBNTC”) and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (“DBTCA”) have been sued by investors in civil litigation concerning their role as trustees of certain residential mortgage backed securities (“RMBS”) trusts.
On December 30, 2015, IKB International, S.A. in Liquidation and IKB Deutsche Industriebank A.G. (collectively, “IKB”), as an investor in 37 RMBS trusts, filed a summons with notice in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County, against DBNTC and DBTCA as trustees of the trusts. On May 27, 2016, IKB served its complaint asserting claims for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of duty to avoid conflicts of interest, violation of the Streit Act, violation of the TIA, violation of Regulation AB, and violation of Section 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code. IKB alleges that DBNTC and DBTCA are liable for over U.S. $268 million in damages. On October 5, 2016, DBNTC and DBTCA, together with several other trustees defending lawsuits by IKB, filed a joint motion to dismiss. On January 6, 2017, IKB filed a notice of discontinuance, voluntarily dismissing with prejudice all claims as to three trusts. On June 20, 2017, the parties filed a stipulation, voluntarily dismissing with prejudice all claims as to four additional trusts. On January 27, 2021, the court granted in part and denied in part DBNTC and DBTCA’s motion to dismiss. The court granted the motion to dismiss with respect to IKB’s claims for violations of the Streit Act, Regulation AB, and Section 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code, as well as certain aspects of IKB’s claims for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, and violation of the TIA. The court denied the remainder of the motion to dismiss. IKB’s remaining claims for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of duty to avoid conflicts of interest, and violation of the TIA will proceed. Discovery is ongoing.
It is DBTCA’s and DBNTC’s belief that they have no pending legal proceedings, including, based on DBTCA’s and DBNTC’s current evaluation, the litigation disclosed in the immediately preceding paragraph that would materially affect their ability to perform their duties as Trustee under the Indenture for this transaction.

Item 1117 of Regulation AB, Legal Proceedings.
There is no significant update regarding the litigation matters described in Redwood’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 under the heading “Item 1117 of Regulation AB, Legal Proceedings.”
The depositor has been notified by Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (“Wells Fargo”) of material pending legal proceedings to which Wells Fargo is subject in connection with its role as trustee on certain RMBS transactions. This Sequoia transaction is not a party to nor subject to the pending legal proceedings.
The disclosure that the depositor received from Wells Fargo is included here:
Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.
Beginning on June 18, 2014, a group of institutional investors filed civil complaints in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County, and later the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., (“Wells Fargo Bank”) in its capacity as trustee for certain residential mortgage backed securities (“RMBS”) trusts. The complaints against Wells Fargo Bank alleged that the trustee caused losses to investors and asserted causes of action based upon, among other things, the trustee's alleged failure to: (i) notify and enforce repurchase obligations of mortgage loan sellers for purported breaches of representations and warranties, (ii) notify investors of alleged events of default, and (iii) abide by appropriate standards of care following alleged events of default. Relief sought included money damages in an unspecified amount, reimbursement of expenses, and
equitable relief. In November 2018, Wells Fargo Bank reached an agreement, in which it denied any wrongdoing, to resolve such claims on a classwide basis for the 271 RMBS trusts at issue. On May 6, 2019, the court entered an order approving the settlement agreement. Separate lawsuits against Wells Fargo Bank making similar allegations filed by certain other institutional investors concerning several RMBS trusts in New York federal and state court are not covered by the settlement agreement.
In addition to the foregoing cases, in August 2014 and August 2015 Nomura Credit & Capital Inc. (“Nomura”) and Natixis Real Estate Holdings, LLC (“Natixis”) filed a total of seven third-party complaints against Wells Fargo Bank in New York state court. In the underlying first-party actions, Nomura and Natixis have been sued for alleged breaches of representations and warranties made in connection with residential mortgage-backed securities sponsored by them. In the third-party actions, Nomura and Natixis allege that Wells Fargo Bank, as master servicer, primary servicer or securities administrator, failed to notify Nomura and Natixis of their own breaches, failed to properly oversee the primary servicers, and failed to adhere to accepted servicing practices. Natixis additionally alleges that Wells Fargo Bank failed to perform default oversight duties. Wells Fargo Bank has asserted counterclaims alleging that Nomura and Natixis failed to provide Wells Fargo Bank notice of their representation and warranty breaches.
With respect to each of the foregoing litigations, Wells Fargo Bank believes plaintiffs' claims are without merit and intends to contest the claims vigorously, but there can be no assurances as to the outcome of the litigations or the possible impact of the litigations on Wells Fargo Bank or the related RMBS trusts.
Item 1119 of Regulation AB, Affiliations and Certain Relationships and Related Transactions.
The seller and servicing administrator, the sponsor and the depositor are each either directly or indirectly wholly-owned subsidiaries of Redwood Trust, Inc. There is not currently, and there was not during the past two years, any material business relationship, agreement, arrangement, transaction or understanding that is or was entered into outside the ordinary course of business or is or was on terms other than would be obtained in an arm’s length transaction with an unrelated third party, between (a) any of the seller, the sponsor, the depositor and the issuing entity on the one hand and (b) any of the trustee, any servicer, the custodian, the master servicer, the securities administrator or either originator of the mortgage loans on the other hand.
Item 1122 of Regulation AB, Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria.
The reports on assessment of compliance with the servicing criteria for asset-backed securities and the related attestation reports on such assessments of compliance are attached hereto under Item 15.

ITEM 1119 OF REGULATION AB. AFFILIATIONS AND CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS.
The Sponsor is the originator, as contemplated by Item 1110 of Regulation AB, of all of the pool assets assigned to World Omni LT (the “Titling Trust”). The Titling Trust issues exchange notes, which are secured by certain leases and leased vehicles allocated to the related reference pool of the Titling Trust, including the 2020-B Reference Pool, to Auto Lease Finance LLC. Auto Lease Finance LLC has sold the exchange note secured by the 2020-B Reference Pool to the Depositor, which has transferred such exchange note to the Issuing Entity. The Sponsor is also the primary servicer. The Depositor is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Sponsor and, therefore, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the originator and the primary servicer. Through its purchase of the Certificates, the Depositor has acquired a 100% ownership interest in the Trust; therefore, the Trust is an affiliated party of the Depositor and, indirectly, of the Sponsor (including in its role as originator and primary servicer).
The Indenture Trustee is not affiliated with any of the Sponsor (including in its role as originator and primary servicer), the Depositor or the Trust. However, the parent of U.S. Bank Trust National Association (the “Owner Trustee”), U.S. Bank National Association, has acquired the debt servicing and securities custody products businesses of the Indenture Trustee. As of March 15, 2021, U.S. Bank National Association succeeded MUFG Union Bank, N.A. as indenture trustee under the indenture. The Owner Trustee is a wholly-owned subsidiary of U.S. Bank National Association and is therefore an affiliated party of U.S. Bank National Association and vice versa. U.S. Bank National Association and MUFG Union Bank, N.A. have entered into an agreement by which MUFG Union Bank, N.A. will continue performing the duties and functions of indenture trustee under the indenture and other transaction documents for a period of time to facilitate an orderly transition. Such transition is currently expected to be completed prior to August 2021.
There are no significant obligors, external enhancement or support providers, or other material parties related to the Notes or Certificates.
In addition, there are no business relationships, agreements, arrangements, transactions or understandings outside the ordinary course of business or on terms other than would be obtained in an arm's length transaction with an unrelated party, apart from the transaction involving the issuance of the Notes and Certificates, or otherwise disclosed herein, by the Trust, between the Sponsor, the Depositor or the Trust and any of the parties mentioned in this Item.
ITEM 1122 OF REGULATION AB. COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE SERVICING CRITERIA.
The Sponsor (in its role as servicer) and the Indenture Trustee (collectively, the ""Servicing Parties"") have each been identified by the registrant as parties participating in the servicing function with respect to the asset pool held by the Trust. Each of the Servicing Parties has completed a report on an assessment of compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to it under Item 1122 of Regulation AB (each, a ""Servicing Report""), which Servicing Reports are attached as exhibits to this Form 10-K. In addition, each of the Servicing Parties has provided an attestation report (each, an ""Attestation Report"") by one or more registered public accounting firms, which reports are also attached as exhibits to this Form 10-K. Neither of the Servicing Reports prepared by the Servicing Parties, or the corresponding Attestation Reports, has identified any material instance of noncompliance with the servicing criteria applicable to the respective Servicing Party.
ITEM 1123 OF REGULATION AB. SERVICER COMPLIANCE STATEMENT.
The Sponsor (in its role as servicer) has been identified by the registrant as servicer with respect to the asset pool held by the Trust. The Sponsor has completed a statement of compliance (a ""Compliance Statement""), signed by an authorized officer of the Sponsor. The Compliance Statement is attached as an exhibit to this Form 10-K.

Item 1117. Legal Proceedings.
In the last several years, U.S. Bank National Association (“U.S. Bank”) and other large financial institutions have been sued in their capacity as trustee or successor trustee for certain residential mortgage backed securities (""RMBS"") trusts. The complaints, primarily filed by investors or investor groups against U.S. Bank and similar institutions, allege the trustees caused losses to investors as a result of alleged failures by the sponsors, mortgage loan sellers and servicers to comply with the governing agreements for these RMBS trusts. Plaintiffs generally assert causes of action based upon the trustees’ purported failures to enforce repurchase obligations of mortgage loan sellers for alleged breaches of representations and warranties, notify securityholders of purported events of default allegedly caused by breaches of servicing standards by mortgage loan servicers and abide by a heightened standard of care following alleged events of default.
U.S. Bank denies liability and believes that it has performed its obligations under the RMBS trusts in good faith, that its actions were not the cause of losses to investors, that it has meritorious defenses, and it has contested and intends to continue contesting the plaintiffs’ claims vigorously. However, U.S. Bank cannot assure you as to the outcome of any of the litigation, or the possible impact of these litigations on the trustee or the RMBS trusts.
On March 9, 2018, a law firm purporting to represent fifteen Delaware statutory trusts (the “DSTs”) that issued securities backed by student loans (the “Student Loans”) filed a lawsuit in the Delaware Court of Chancery against U.S. Bank National Association (“U.S. Bank”) in its capacities as indenture trustee and successor special servicer, and three other institutions in their respective transaction capacities, with respect to the DSTs and the Student Loans. This lawsuit is captioned The National Collegiate Student Loan Master Trust I, et al. v. U.S. Bank National Association, et al., C.A. No. 2018-0167-JRS (Del. Ch.) (the “NCMSLT Action”). The complaint, as amended on June 15, 2018, alleged that the DSTs have been harmed as a result of purported misconduct or omissions by the defendants concerning administration of the trusts and special servicing of the Student Loans. Since the filing of the NCMSLT Action, certain Student Loan borrowers have made assertions against U.S. Bank concerning special servicing that appear to be based on certain allegations made on behalf of the DSTs in the NCMSLT Action.
U.S. Bank has filed a motion seeking dismissal of the operative complaint in its entirety with prejudice pursuant to Chancery Court Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) or, in the alternative, a stay of the case while other prior filed disputes involving the DSTs and the Student Loans are litigated. On November 7, 2018, the Court ruled that the case should be stayed in its entirety pending resolution of the first-filed cases. On January 21, 2020, the Court entered an order consolidating for pretrial purposes the NCMSLT Action and three other lawsuits pending in the Delaware Court of Chancery concerning the DSTs and the Student Loans, which remains pending.
U.S. Bank denies liability in the NCMSLT Action and believes it has performed its obligations as indenture trustee and special servicer in good faith and in compliance in all material respects with the terms of the agreements governing the DSTs and that it has meritorious defenses. It has contested and intends to continue contesting the plaintiffs’ claims vigorously.
Item 1119. Affiliations and Certain Relationships and Related Transactions.

Organization
BCTC V Assignor Corp., a Delaware corporation, is the assignor limited partner (the “Assignor Limited Partner”) of BF Garden Tax Credit Fund V L.P. (formerly known as Boston Capital Tax Credit Fund V L.P.), a Delaware limited partnership (the ""Fund"") and does not engage in any other business. Units of beneficial interest in the limited partnership interest of the Assignor Limited Partner have been assigned by the Assignor Limited Partner by means of beneficial assignee certificates (“BACs”) to investors and investors are entitled to all the rights and economic benefits of a limited partner of the Fund, including rights to a percentage of the income, gains, losses, deductions, credits and distributions of the Fund.
Effective as of December 15, 2020, BF Garden Companion Limited Partnership, a Massachusetts limited partnership formerly known as Boston Capital Companion Limited Partnership (“Companion”) replaced John P. Manning as the sole owner of the Assignor Limited Partner. Also effective as of December 15, 2020, BFBC Holdings GP, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and an affiliate of Boston Financial Investment Management, LP, a Delaware limited partnership (“BFIM”),replaced Boston Capital Partners II Corporation as the general partner of Companion, and BFIM replaced Boston Capital Companion Holdings Limited Partnership as the sole limited partner of Companion.
A Registration Statement on Form S-11 and the related prospectus, (the ""Prospectus"") were filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and became effective January 2, 2004 in connection with a public offering (""Offering"") in one or more series of a minimum of 250,000 BACs and a maximum of 7,000,000 BACs at $10 per BAC. On August 10, 2004 an amendment to Form S-11, which registered an additional 8,500,000 BACs for sale to the public in one or more series became effective. As of December 31, 2020, subscriptions had been received and accepted by the Fund for 11,777,706 BACs representing capital contributions of $117,777,060.
Description of Business
The Assignor Limited Partner’s sole purpose is to act as a conduit through which all of the economic and tax benefits of an investment in the Fund are passed along to the investor BAC holders. The Assignor Limited Partner does not charge any fees for its services and has no income.
The Fund's principal business is to invest as a limited partner in other limited partnerships (the ""Operating Partnerships"") each of which will own or lease and will operate an apartment complex exclusively or partially for low- and moderate-income tenants. Each Operating Partnership in which the Fund will invest will own apartment complexes which are completed, newly-constructed, under construction or rehabilitation, or to-be constructed or rehabilitated, and which are expected to receive government assistance. Each apartment complex is expected to qualify for the low-income housing tax credit under Section 42 of the Code (the ""Federal Housing Tax Credit""), providing tax benefits over a period of ten to twelve years in the form of tax credits which investors may use to offset income, subject to strict limitations, from other sources. Some apartment complexes may also qualify for the historic rehabilitation tax credit under Section 47 of the Code (the ""Rehabilitation Tax Credit""). Section 236 (f) (ii) of the National Housing Act, as amended, and Section 101 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965, as amended, each provide for the making by The Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) of rent supplement payments to low income tenants in properties which receive other forms of federal assistance such as tax credits. The payments for each tenant, which are made directly to the owner of their property, generally are in such amounts as to enable the tenant to pay rent equal to 30% of the adjusted family income. Some of the apartment complexes in which the Fund has invested are receiving rent supplements from HUD. HUD has been in the process of converting rent supplement assistance to assistance paid not to the owner of the apartment complex, but directly to the individuals. At this time, the Fund is unable to predict whether Congress will continue rent supplement programs payable directly to owners of the apartment complex.
As of December 31, 2020, the Fund had invested in 5 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 47, 2 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 48, and 21 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 49.
The business objectives of the Fund are to:
(1) provide current tax benefits to investors in the form of Federal Housing Tax Credits and in, limited instances, a small amount of Rehabilitation Tax Credits, which an investor may apply, subject to strict limitations, against the investor's federal income tax liability from active, portfolio and passive income;
(2) preserve and protect the Fund's capital and provide capital appreciation and cash distributions through increases in value of the Fund's investments and, to the extent applicable, equity buildup through periodic payments on the mortgage indebtedness with respect to the apartment complexes;
(3) provide tax benefits in the form of passive losses which an investor may apply to offset his passive income (if any); and
(4) provide cash distributions (except with respect to the Fund's investment in various non-profit Operating Partnerships) from capital transaction proceeds. The Operating Partnerships intend to hold the apartment complexes for appreciation in value. The Operating Partnerships may sell the apartment complexes after a period of time if financial conditions in the future make such sales desirable and if such sales are permitted by government restrictions.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures
(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Assignor Limited Partner, under the supervision and with the participation of the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Assignor Limited Partner's ""disclosure controls and procedures"" as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ""Exchange Act"") Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15. Based on that evaluation, the Assignor Limited Partner's Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, the Assignor Limited Partner's disclosure controls and procedures were adequate and effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to the Assignor Limited Partner required to be included in the Assignor Limited Partner's periodic SEC filings.
(b) Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Management of the Assignor Limited Partner is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). The Assignor Limited Partner's internal control system over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Assignor Limited Partner's management regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
Due to inherent limitations, an internal control system over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives.
As required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Assignor Limited Partner’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on this evaluation, management concluded the Assignor Limited Partner’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020.
(c) Changes in Internal Controls
There were no changes in the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2020 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting.

Owner Trustee Litigation
BNY Mellon Trust of Delaware is an affiliate of The Bank of New York Mellon, which provides support services on its behalf in connection with the Capital One Prime Auto Receivables Trust 2020-1 transaction. In the ordinary course of business, The Bank of New York Mellon is named as a defendant in legal actions. In connection with its role as trustee of certain residential mortgage-backed securitization (“RMBS”) transactions, The Bank of New York Mellon has been named as a defendant in a number of legal actions brought by RMBS investors. These lawsuits allege that the trustee had expansive duties under the governing agreements, including the duty to investigate and pursue breach of representation and warranty claims against other parties to the RMBS transactions. While it is inherently difficult to predict the eventual outcomes of pending actions, The Bank of New York Mellon denies liability and intends to defend the litigations vigorously.
The Bank of New York Mellon has provided us with the information under the caption “Owner Trustee Litigation” immediately above in response to the requirements of Regulation AB. Neither the Sponsor nor its affiliates is a party to any such litigation.

Substitute information provided in accordance with General Instruction J to Form 10-K:
Item 1112(b) of Regulation AB. Significant Obligors of Pool Assets (Financial Information).
No single obligor represents more than 10% of the pool assets held by Honda Auto Receivables 2018-1 Owner Trust (the “Trust”).
Item 1114(b)(2) of Regulation AB. Credit Enhancement and Other Support, Except for Certain Derivatives Instruments (Information Regarding Significant Enhancement Providers).
No entity or group of affiliated entities provides any external credit enhancement or other support with respect to either payment on the pool assets held by the Trust or payments on the notes (the “Notes”) or certificates (the “Certificates”) issued by the Trust.
Item 1115(b) of Regulation AB. Certain Derivatives Instruments (Financial Information).
No entity or group of affiliated entities provides any derivative instruments that are used to alter the payment characteristics of the cashflows from the Trust.
Item 1117 of Regulation AB. Legal Proceedings.
No legal proceedings are pending, and no proceedings are known to be contemplated by governmental authorities, against any of the following companies: American Honda Finance Corporation (the “Sponsor”), American Honda Receivables LLC (the “Depositor”), or the Trust, or of which any property of the foregoing is the subject, that are or would be material to holders of the Notes or the Certificates.
U.S. Bank National Association (the “Indenture Trustee”), has provided the information contained in the following paragraphs for purposes of compliance with Regulation AB.
In the last several years, U.S. Bank National Association (“U.S. Bank”) and other large financial institutions have been sued in their capacity as trustee or successor trustee for certain residential mortgage backed securities (""RMBS"") trusts. The complaints, primarily filed by investors or investor groups against U.S. Bank and similar institutions, allege the trustees caused losses to investors as a result of alleged failures by the sponsors, mortgage loan sellers and servicers to comply with the governing agreements for these RMBS trusts. Plaintiffs generally assert causes of action based upon the trustees’ purported failures to enforce repurchase obligations of mortgage loan sellers for alleged breaches of representations and warranties, notify securityholders of purported events of default allegedly caused by breaches of servicing standards by mortgage loan servicers and abide by a heightened standard of care following alleged events of default.
- 2 -
U.S. Bank denies liability and believes that it has performed its obligations under the RMBS trusts in good faith, that its actions were not the cause of losses to investors, that it has meritorious defenses, and it has contested and intends to continue contesting the plaintiffs’ claims vigorously. However, U.S. Bank cannot assure you as to the outcome of any of the litigation, or the possible impact of these litigations on the trustee or the RMBS trusts.
On March 9, 2018, a law firm purporting to represent fifteen Delaware statutory trusts (the “DSTs”) that issued securities backed by student loans (the “Student Loans”) filed a lawsuit in the Delaware Court of Chancery against U.S. Bank National Association (“U.S. Bank”) in its capacities as indenture trustee and successor special servicer, and three other institutions in their respective transaction capacities, with respect to the DSTs and the Student Loans. This lawsuit is captioned The National Collegiate Student Loan Master Trust I, et al. v. U.S. Bank National Association, et al., C.A. No. 2018-0167-JRS (Del. Ch.) (the “NCMSLT Action”). The complaint, as amended on June 15, 2018, alleged that the DSTs have been harmed as a result of purported misconduct or omissions by the defendants concerning administration of the trusts and special servicing of the Student Loans. Since the filing of the NCMSLT Action, certain Student Loan borrowers have made assertions against U.S. Bank concerning special servicing that appear to be based on certain allegations made on behalf of the DSTs in the NCMSLT Action.
U.S. Bank believes that it has performed its obligations as indenture trustee and special servicer in good faith and in compliance in all material respects with the terms of the agreements governing the DSTs (the “Governing Agreements”), and accordingly that the claims against it in the NCMSLT Action are without merit.
U.S. Bank has filed a motion seeking dismissal of the operative complaint in its entirety with prejudice pursuant to Chancery Court Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) or, in the alternative, a stay of the case while other prior filed disputes involving the DSTs and the Student Loans are litigated. On November 7, 2018, the Court ruled that the case should be stayed in its entirety pending resolution of the first-filed cases. On January 21, 2020, the Court entered an order consolidating for pretrial purposes the NCMSLT Action and three other lawsuits pending in the Delaware Court of Chancery concerning the DSTs and the Student Loans (the “Consolidated Action”). U.S. Bank and other parties to the Consolidated Action have briefed and argued motions for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Chancery Court Rule 12(c) regarding disputed issues of contractual interpretation at issue in one or more of the cases comprising the Consolidated Action, including the NCMSLT Action. The Court has not yet ruled on these motions or on U.S. Bank’s dismissal motion in the NCMSLT Action.
U.S. Bank intends to continue to defend the NCMSLT Action vigorously.
The Bank of New York Mellon (the “Owner Trustee”) and BNY Mellon Trust of Delaware (the “Delaware Trustee”) has provided the information contained in the following paragraphs for purposes of compliance with Regulation AB.
In the ordinary course of business, The Bank of New York Mellon, The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., and BNY Mellon Trust of Delaware (collectively, “BNY Mellon”) are named as a defendant in legal actions. In connection with its role as trustee of certain residential mortgage-backed securitization (“RMBS”) transactions, BNY Mellon has been named as a defendant in a number of legal actions brought by RMBS investors. These lawsuits allege that the trustee had expansive duties under the governing agreements, including the duty to investigate and pursue breach of representation and warranty claims against other parties to the RMBS transactions. While it is inherently difficult to predict the eventual outcomes of pending actions, BNY Mellon denies liability and intends to defend the litigations vigorously.

ITEM 1117 OF REGULATION AB. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
The Sponsor and the Servicer
The sponsor is subject to various pending and potential legal and regulatory proceedings in the ordinary course of business, including litigation, arbitration, claims, investigations, examinations, subpoenas and enforcement proceedings. Some litigation against the sponsor could take the form of class actions. The outcomes of these proceedings are inherently uncertain, and thus the sponsor cannot confidently predict how or when these proceedings will be resolved. An adverse outcome in one or more of these proceedings could result in substantial damages, settlements, fines, penalties, diminished income or reputational harm to the sponsor, and could materially and adversely affect the interest of the noteholders or the servicer’s ability to perform its duties under the transaction documents.
The Trustee and the Trust Collateral Agent
In the ordinary course of business, The Bank of New York Mellon is named as a defendant in legal actions. In connection with its role as trustee of certain residential mortgage-backed securitization, or RMBS, transactions, The Bank of New York Mellon has been named as a defendant in a number of legal actions brought by RMBS investors. These lawsuits allege that the trustee had expansive duties under the governing agreements, including the duty to investigate and pursue breach of representation and warranty claims against other parties to the RMBS transactions. While it is inherently difficult to predict the eventual outcomes of pending actions, The Bank of New York Mellon denies liability and intends to defend the litigations vigorously.

Item 16. Form 10-K Summary.
Not applicable.
SUBSTITUTE INFORMATION PROVIDED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERAL INSTRUCTION J TO FORM 10-K:
Item 1112(b) of Regulation AB. Significant Obligors of Pool Assets (Financial Information).
Not applicable.
Item 1114(b)(2) of Regulation AB. Credit Enhancement and Other Support, Except for Certain Derivatives Instruments (Information Regarding Significant Enhancement Providers).
Not applicable.
Item 1115(b) of Regulation AB. Certain Derivatives Instruments (Financial Information).
Not applicable.
Item 1117 of Regulation AB. Legal Proceedings.
Except as disclosed in the following paragraph, there are no legal proceedings pending or proceedings known to be contemplated by governmental authorities against any of Synchrony Card Master Issuance Trust (the “Issuing Entity”), The Bank of New York Mellon (”BNY”), as indenture trustee (the “Indenture Trustee”), Citibank, N.A. (“Citibank”), as owner trustee (the “Owner Trustee”), Citicorp Trust Delaware, National Association, as Delaware trustee (the “Delaware Trustee”), Synchrony Bank (the “Sponsor”) or Synchrony Card Funding, LLC (the “Depositor”) or of which any property of the foregoing is subject, that are material to holders of the notes of Synchrony Card Issuance Trust.
In the ordinary course of business, BNY is named as a defendant in legal actions. In connection with its role as trustee of certain residential mortgage-backed securitization (“RMBS”) transactions, BNY has been named as a defendant in a number of legal actions brought by RMBS investors. These lawsuits allege that the trustee had expansive duties under the governing agreements, including the duty to investigate and pursue breach of representation and warranty claims against other parties to the RMBS transactions. While it is inherently difficult to predict the eventual outcomes of pending actions, BNY denies liability and intends to defend the litigations vigorously.
Item 1119 of Regulation AB. Affiliations and Certain Relationships and Related Transactions.
The information required by item 1119 of Regulation AB has been omitted from this report on Form 10-K in reliance on the Instruction to Item 1119.
Item 1122 of Regulation AB. Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria.
Each of the Sponsor and BNY (in its capacity as Indenture Trustee) (collectively, the “PPSFs”) has been identified by the registrant as parties participating in the servicing function with respect to more than 5% of the pool assets held by the Issuing Entity. Each of the PPSFs has completed a report on an assessment of compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to it (each, a “Servicing Report”), which Servicing Reports are attached as exhibits to this Form 10-K. In addition, each of the PPSFs has provided an attestation report (each, an “Attestation Report”) by one or more registered public accounting firms, which Attestation Reports are also attached as exhibits to this Form 10-K. Neither the Servicing Reports nor the Attestation Reports have identified any material instances of noncompliance with the servicing criteria applicable to the PPSFs, except as set forth in the following paragraph.
The Servicing Report and the Attestation Report for BNY identified the following material instances of non-compliance with servicing criterion 1122(d)(2)(vii)(A),(B),(C),(D), as applicable to BNY during the year ended December 31, 2020: certain reconciliations were not prepared on a monthly basis for all asset-backed securities related bank accounts, including custodial accounts. The Servicing Report and the Attestation Report for BNY are at a platform level which includes publicly issued asset-backed securities issued on or after January 1, 2006 and like-kind transactions issued prior to January 1, 2006 that are subject to Regulation AB (including transactions subject to Regulation AB by contractual obligation) for which BNY provides trustee, securities administration, paying agent or custodian services, as defined and to the extent applicable in the transaction agreements, other than residential mortgage-backed securities and other mortgage-related asset-backed securities. Because the material instance of non-compliance did not relate to BNY’s role as Indenture Trustee for securities issued by the registrant, the Depositor and the Sponsor believe that BNY’s noncompliance with the applicable servicing criteria had no adverse impact on the Issuing Entity’s noteholders.
Item 1123 of Regulation AB. Servicer Compliance Statement.
The Sponsor has completed a Statement of Compliance with applicable servicing criteria (the “Compliance Statement”) signed by an authorized officer of such servicer. The Compliance Statement is attached as an exhibit to this 10-K.

Item 1115(b) of Regulation AB. Certain Derivatives Instruments (Financial Information).
Based on the standards set forth in Item 1115(b) of Regulation AB, no information is required in response to this item.
Item 1117 of Regulation AB. Legal Proceedings.
There are no legal proceedings pending, or any proceedings known to be contemplated by governmental authorities, against CarMax Business Services, LLC (the “Sponsor” and, in its role as the servicer, the “Servicer”), CarMax Auto Funding LLC (the “Depositor”), the Issuing Entity or the other parties described in Item 1117 of Regulation AB, or of which any property of the foregoing is the subject, that are material to holders of the Notes.
U.S. Bank National Association (the “Indenture Trustee”), has provided the following information for inclusion in this report:
In the last several years, U.S. Bank National Association (U.S. Bank) and other large financial institutions have been sued in their capacity as trustee or successor trustee for certain residential mortgage backed securities (""RMBS"") trusts. The complaints, primarily filed by investors or investor groups against U.S. Bank and similar institutions, allege the trustees caused losses to investors as a result of alleged failures by the sponsors, mortgage loan sellers and servicers to comply with the governing agreements for these RMBS trusts. Plaintiffs generally assert causes of action based upon the trustees’ purported failures to enforce repurchase obligations of mortgage loan sellers for alleged breaches of representations and warranties, notify securityholders of purported events of default allegedly caused by breaches of servicing standards by mortgage loan servicers and abide by a heightened standard of care following alleged events of default. Currently, U.S. Bank is a defendant in multiple actions alleging individual or class action claims against it.
U.S. Bank denies liability and believes that it has performed its obligations under the RMBS trusts in good faith, that its actions were not the cause of losses to investors, that it has meritorious defenses, and it has contested and intends to continue
contesting the plaintiffs’ claims vigorously. However, U.S. Bank cannot assure you as to the outcome of any of the litigation, or the possible impact of these litigations on the trustee or the RMBS trusts.
On March 9, 2018, a law firm purporting to represent fifteen Delaware statutory trusts (the DSTs) that issued securities backed by student loans (the Student Loans) filed a lawsuit in the Delaware Court of Chancery against U.S. Bank National Association (U.S. Bank) in its capacities as indenture trustee and successor special servicer, and three other institutions in their respective transaction capacities, with respect to the DSTs and the Student Loans. This lawsuit is captioned The National Collegiate Student Loan Master Trust I, et al. v. U.S. Bank National Association, et al., C.A. No. 2018-0167-JRS (Del. Ch.). The complaint, which was later amended on June 15, 2018, alleged that the DSTs have been harmed as a result of purported misconduct or omissions by the defendants concerning administration of the trusts and servicing of the student loans.
U.S. Bank believes that it has performed its obligations as indenture trustee and special servicer in good faith and in compliance in all material respects with the terms of the agreements governing the DSTs (the Governing Agreements), and accordingly that the claims against it in the lawsuit are without merit.
U.S. Bank has filed a motion seeking dismissal of the operative complaint in its entirety with prejudice pursuant to Chancery Court Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) or, in the alternative, U.S. Bank requested a stay of the case while other prior filed disputes involving the DSTs and the Student Loans are being litigated. On November 7, 2018, the Court ruled that the case should be stayed in its entirety pending resolution of the first-filed cases.
U.S. Bank intends to continue to defend this lawsuit vigorously.

Item 1117 of Regulation AB. Legal Proceedings.
Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as the indenture trustee, has provided the following information:
Beginning on June 18, 2014, a group of institutional investors filed civil complaints in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County, and later the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., (“Wells Fargo Bank”) in its capacity as trustee for certain residential mortgage backed securities (“RMBS”) trusts. The complaints against Wells Fargo Bank alleged that the trustee caused losses to investors and asserted causes of action based upon, among other things, the trustee’s alleged failure to: (i) notify and enforce repurchase obligations of mortgage loan sellers for purported breaches of representations and warranties, (ii) notify investors of alleged events of default, and (iii) abide by appropriate standards of care following alleged events of default. Relief sought included money damages in an unspecified amount, reimbursement of expenses, and equitable relief. In November 2018, Wells Fargo Bank reached an agreement, in which it denied any wrongdoing, to resolve such claims on a classwide basis for the 271 RMBS trusts at issue. On May 6, 2019, the court entered an order approving the settlement agreement. Separate lawsuits against Wells Fargo Bank making similar allegations filed by certain other institutional investors concerning several RMBS trusts in New York federal and state court are not covered by the settlement agreement.
In addition to the foregoing cases, in August 2014 and August 2015 Nomura Credit & Capital Inc. (“Nomura”) and Natixis Real Estate Holdings, LLC (“Natixis”) filed a total of seven third-party complaints against Wells Fargo Bank in New York state court. In the underlying first-party actions, Nomura and Natixis have been sued for alleged breaches of representations and warranties made in connection with residential mortgage-backed securities sponsored by them. In the third-party actions, Nomura and Natixis allege that Wells Fargo Bank, as master servicer, primary servicer or securities administrator, failed to notify Nomura and Natixis of their own breaches, failed to properly oversee the primary servicers, and failed to adhere to accepted servicing practices. Natixis additionally alleges that Wells Fargo Bank failed to perform default oversight duties. Wells Fargo Bank has asserted counterclaims alleging that Nomura and Natixis failed to provide Wells Fargo Bank notice of their representation and warranty breaches.
With respect to each of the foregoing litigations, Wells Fargo Bank believes plaintiffs’ claims are without merit and intends to contest the claims vigorously, but there can be no assurances as to the outcome of the litigations or the possible impact of the litigations on Wells Fargo Bank or the related RMBS trusts.

None.
Item 1115(b) of Regulation AB. Certain Derivatives Instruments (Financial Information)
No entity or group of affiliated entities provides any derivatives instruments that are used to alter payments characteristics of the cash flows from the Trust.
Item 1117 of Regulation AB. Legal Proceedings
No legal proceedings are pending against any of Mechanics Bank (the “Sponsor”), California Republic Funding, LLC (the “Depositor”), or the Trust, or against any property of any such entities that are or would be material to holders of the Notes or certificates (the “Certificates”) issued by the Trust.
U.S. Bank National Association, the Indenture Trustee with respect to the Trust, has provided the following disclosure:
In the last several years, U.S. Bank National Association (“U.S. Bank”) and other large financial institutions have been sued in their capacity as trustee or successor trustee for certain residential mortgage backed securities (“RMBS”) trusts. The complaints, primarily filed by investors or investor groups against U.S. Bank and similar institutions, allege the trustees caused losses to investors as a result of alleged failures by the sponsors, mortgage loan sellers and servicers to comply with the governing agreements for these RMBS trusts. Plaintiffs generally assert causes of action based upon the trustees’ purported failures to enforce repurchase obligations of mortgage loan sellers for alleged breaches of representations and warranties, notify securityholders of purported events of default allegedly caused by breaches of servicing standards by mortgage loan servicers and abide by a heightened standard of care following alleged events of default.
U.S. Bank denies liability and believes that it has performed its obligations under the RMBS trusts in good faith, that its actions were not the cause of losses to investors, that it has meritorious defenses, and it has contested and intends to continue contesting the plaintiffs’ claims vigorously. However, U.S. Bank cannot assure you as to the outcome of any of the litigation, or the possible impact of these litigations on the trustee or the RMBS trusts. U.S. Bank intends to continue to defend this lawsuit vigorously.
Item 1119 of Regulation AB. Affiliations and Certain Relationships and Related Transactions.
The Sponsor is the originator, as contemplated by Item 1110 of Regulation AB, of all the pool assets owned by the Trust. The Sponsor is also the servicer. The Depositor is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Sponsor and, therefore, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the originator and the servicer.
The Indenture Trustee is not affiliated with the Sponsor (including in its role as originator and servicer), the Depositor, or the Trust. The Owner Trustee is not affiliated with the Sponsor or the Depositor.
There are no significant obligors or support providers, or other material parties related to the Notes or Certificates.
In addition, there are no business relationships, agreements, arrangements, transactions or understanding outside the ordinary course of business or on terms other than would be obtained in an arm’s length transaction with an unrelated party, apart from the transaction involving the issuance of the Notes and Certificates by the Trust, between the Sponsor, the Depositor or the Trust and any of the parties mentioned in this Item.
Item 1122 of Regulation AB. Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria.
The Sponsor (in its role as servicer), and the Indenture Trustee (the Sponsor, as servicer, and the Indenture Trustee collectively as the “Servicing Participants”) have each been identified by the Depositor as participating in the servicing function with respect to the asset pool held by the Trust. The Servicing Participants have each completed a report on an assessment of compliance with its respective servicing functions (each, a “Servicing Report”), which Servicing Reports are attached as exhibits to this Form 10-K. Neither the Servicing Reports prepared by any of the Servicing Participants, nor the Attestation Reports provided by the Servicing Participants’ respective registered public accounting firms have identified any material instance of noncompliance with the servicing criteria applicable to the respective Servicing Participant.
Item 1123 of Regulation AB. Servicer Compliance Statement.
The Sponsor (in its role as servicer) has been identified by the Depositor as a servicer with respect to the asset pool held by the Trust. The Sponsor has completed a statement of compliance with applicable servicing criteria (the “Compliance Statement”), signed by an authorized officer of the Sponsor. The Compliance Statement is attached as an exhibit to this Form 10-K.

The Bank of New York Mellon (formerly The Bank of New York) (“BNYM” and as US$ note trustee, US$ note registrar and principal paying agent) has provided the following disclosure for inclusion in this Form 10-K: In the ordinary course of business, The Bank of New York Mellon, The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., and BNY Mellon Trust of Delaware (collectively, “BNY Mellon”) are named as a defendant in legal actions. In connection with its role as trustee of certain residential mortgage-backed securitization (“RMBS”) transactions, BNY Mellon has been named as a defendant in a number of legal actions brought by RMBS investors. These lawsuits allege that the trustee had expansive duties under the governing agreements, including the duty to investigate and pursue breach of representation and warranty claims against other parties to the RMBS transactions. While it is inherently difficult to predict the eventual outcomes of pending actions, BNY Mellon denies liability and intends to defend the litigations vigorously.
We have not independently verified the accuracy of BNYM’s assertions or the adequacy of its remediation efforts.

Owner Trustee Litigation
BNY Mellon Trust of Delaware is an affiliate of The Bank of New York Mellon, which provides support services on its behalf in connection with the Capital One Prime Auto Receivables Trust 2019-1 transaction. In the ordinary course of business, The Bank of New York Mellon is named as a defendant in legal actions. In connection with its role as trustee of certain residential mortgage-backed securitization (“RMBS”) transactions, The Bank of New York Mellon has been named as a defendant in a number of legal actions brought by RMBS investors. These lawsuits allege that the trustee had expansive duties under the governing agreements, including the duty to investigate and pursue breach of representation and warranty claims against other parties to the RMBS transactions. While it is inherently difficult to predict the eventual outcomes of pending actions, The Bank of New York Mellon denies liability and intends to defend the litigations vigorously.
The Bank of New York Mellon has provided us with the information under the caption “Owner Trustee Litigation” immediately above in response to the requirements of Regulation AB. Neither the Sponsor nor its affiliates is a party to any such litigation.

Item 1117 of Regulation AB, Legal Proceedings.
The registrant knows of no legal proceeding pending against the sponsors, depositor, trustee, issuing entity, servicer contemplated by Item 1108(a)(3) of Regulation AB, originator contemplated by Item 1110(b) of Regulation AB, or other party contemplated by Item 1100(d)(1) of Regulation AB, or of which any property of the foregoing is the subject, that is material to security holders, other than as follows:
Beginning on June 18, 2014, a group of institutional investors filed civil complaints in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County, and later the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., (“Wells Fargo Bank”) in its capacity as trustee for certain residential mortgage backed securities (“RMBS”) trusts. The complaints against Wells Fargo Bank alleged that the trustee caused losses to investors and asserted causes of action based upon, among other things, the trustee's alleged failure to: (i) notify and enforce repurchase obligations of mortgage loan sellers for purported breaches of representations and warranties, (ii) notify investors of alleged events of default, and (iii) abide by appropriate standards of care following alleged events of default. Relief sought included money damages in an unspecified amount, reimbursement of expenses, and equitable relief. In November 2018, Wells Fargo Bank reached an agreement, in which it denied any wrongdoing, to resolve such claims on a classwide basis for the 271 RMBS trusts at issue. On May 6, 2019, the court entered an order approving the settlement agreement. Separate lawsuits against Wells Fargo Bank making similar allegations filed by certain other institutional investors concerning several RMBS trusts in New York federal and state court are not covered by the settlement agreement. In addition to the foregoing cases, in August 2014 and August 2015 Nomura Credit & Capital Inc. (“Nomura”) and Natixis Real Estate Holdings, LLC (“Natixis”) filed a total of seven third-party complaints against Wells Fargo Bank in New York state court. In the underlying first-party actions, Nomura and Natixis have been sued for alleged breaches of representations and warranties made in connection with residential mortgage-backed securities sponsored by them. In the third-party actions, Nomura and Natixis allege that Wells Fargo Bank, as master servicer, primary servicer or securities administrator, failed to notify Nomura and Natixis of their own breaches, failed to properly oversee the primary servicers, and failed to adhere to accepted servicing practices. Natixis additionally alleges that Wells Fargo Bank failed to perform default oversight duties. Wells Fargo Bank has asserted counterclaims alleging that Nomura and Natixis failed to provide Wells Fargo Bank notice of their representation and warranty breaches. With respect to each of the foregoing litigations, Wells Fargo Bank believes plaintiffs' claims are without merit and intends to contest the claims vigorously, but there can be no assurances as to the outcome of the litigations or the possible impact of the litigations on Wells Fargo Bank or the related RMBS trusts.
In the last several years, U.S. Bank National Association (“U.S. Bank”) and other large financial institutions have been sued in their capacity as trustee or successor trustee for certain residential mortgage backed securities (""RMBS"") trusts. The complaints, primarily filed by investors or investor groups against U.S. Bank and similar institutions, allege the trustees caused losses to investors as a result of alleged failures by the sponsors, mortgage loan sellers and servicers to comply with the governing agreements for these RMBS trusts. Plaintiffs generally assert causes of action based upon the trustees’ purported failures to enforce repurchase obligations of mortgage loan sellers for alleged breaches of representations and warranties, notify securityholders of purported events of default allegedly caused by breaches of servicing standards by mortgage loan servicers and abide by a heightened standard of care following alleged events of default.
U.S. Bank denies liability and believes that it has performed its obligations under the RMBS trusts in good faith, that its actions were not the cause of losses to investors, that it has meritorious defenses, and it has contested and intends to continue contesting the plaintiffs’ claims vigorously. However, U.S. Bank cannot assure you as to the outcome of any of the litigation, or the possible impact of these litigations on the trustee or the RMBS trusts.
On March 9, 2018, a law firm purporting to represent fifteen Delaware statutory trusts (the “DSTs”) that issued securities backed by student loans (the “Student Loans”) filed a lawsuit in the Delaware Court of Chancery against U.S. Bank National Association (“U.S. Bank”) in its capacities as indenture trustee and successor special servicer, and three other institutions in their respective transaction capacities, with respect to the DSTs and the Student Loans. This lawsuit is captioned The National Collegiate Student Loan Master Trust I, et al. v. U.S. Bank National Association, et al., C.A. No. 2018-0167-JRS (Del. Ch.) (the “NCMSLT Action”). The complaint, as amended on June 15, 2018, alleged that the DSTs have been harmed as a result of purported misconduct or omissions by the defendants concerning administration of the trusts and special servicing of the Student Loans. Since the filing of the NCMSLT Action, certain Student Loan borrowers have made assertions against U.S. Bank concerning special servicing that appear to be based on certain allegations made on behalf of the DSTs in the NCMSLT Action.
U.S. Bank believes that it has performed its obligations as indenture trustee and special servicer in good faith and in compliance in all material respects with the terms of the agreements governing the DSTs (the “Governing Agreements”), and accordingly that the claims against it in the NCMSLT Action are without merit.
U.S. Bank has filed a motion seeking dismissal of the operative complaint in its entirety with prejudice pursuant to Chancery Court Rules 12(b)(1) and 12 (b)(6) or, in the alternative, a stay of the case while other prior filed disputes involving the DSTs and the Student Loans are litigated. On November 7, 2018, the Court ruled that the case should be stayed in its entirety pending resolution of the first-filed cases. On January 21, 2020, the Court entered an order consolidating for pretrial purposes the NCMSLT Action and three other lawsuits pending in the Delaware Court of Chancery concerning the DSTs and the Student Loans (the “Consolidated Action”). U.S. Bank and other parties to the Consolidated Action have briefed and argued motions for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Chancery Court Rule 12(c) regarding disputed issues of contractual interpretation at issue in one or more of the cases comprising the Consolidated Action, including the NCMSLT Action. The Court has not yet ruled on these motions or on U.S. Bank’s dismissal motion in the NCMSLT Action.
U.S. Bank intends to continue to defend the NCMSLT Action vigorously.
