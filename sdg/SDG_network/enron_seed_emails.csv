Rod,

Would you please forward me the CAPEX numbers when Tracy e-mails them to you?  Jayshree indicated that she needs those numbers and it will be easier to send in soft form.

Also, to confirm the numbers in the information you gave me are 30.86 MM for 2001 (this does not include Red Rock) and $68.4 in 2002 (this includes $47 MM for Red Rock).  I am assuming that on page three of the 2001-2003 projections that really captures 2002-2004 the operations numbers are in 000s not millions as noted above.  If this is true you have 15 billion in operations CAPEX - which I don't believe is true.  Let me know.

Thanks
Sarah"

Willard Kinzer, via his wholly owned LDC Belfry Gas, has 142/day of firm 
transport available on 8/1/2000 for one year, which delivers into TCO.  He 
has released and sold this in the past, as he has his own supply that he uses 
to feed his Belfry Gas market.  (Kinzer is the largest independent producer 
in Kentucky, with about 18,000/day).

"Hi Kay -

You may recall that back in February, we almost finalized two
confidentiality agreements related to enovate L.L.C. activities.  Our
auditors will be sending to enovate shortly a letter indicating they would
like to review various books and records of enovate and ENA as its
activities relate to enovate.  In connection with the review, we need to
finalize those confidentiality agreements.

I have made the change you requested in the attached e-mail to both of the
agreements (PEC and enovate) and have attached below an execution copy of
the agreements for ENA to date and send to PEC and enovate for siganture.
Assuming the attached copies are acceptable, please have ENA sign two
originals of each agreement and send them to me.  I'll arrange for Bill
Morrow to sign the PEC agreement and work with Greg Penmen to have enovate
sign the other agreement.

If you have any questions, please call.  Thanks for your assistance.

""California made two big mistakes:  First, they never made a market.  They didn't deregulate.  They just re-regulated the failed monopoly structure they'd been living with for decades.  Second, when the first mistake led to an energy crisis, California's leaders didn't stop, learn from their mistakes, and get deregulation right.  Instead, they blamed everyone but themselves, including Enron.  Those mistakes led to the nightmare California's been living for over a year now, and they still California still has woken up.""
""Enron's the model of the virtual organization.  Whether the problem's in California, or India or Sweden, Enron creates the virtual organization needed to solve the problem.  That's what we did in California.  Houston is definitely the brain, but you need all the other limbs and organs to function well.  What makes the ""virtual"" part of it work is a committed management team, great technology and an incredible team of talented, flexible folks from across the company.  That allowed us to coordinate extremely well under challenging conditions. It's been a great experience."""

"    Tim,
     Wednesday the California Deputy
Attorney General agreed to the following treatment of email at the Portland
facility.  I confirmed this procedure in writing to him and have not heard
any disagreement:

    In Portland, we proposed to handle business
email related to the topics in your preservation letter by instructing
employees not to delete any email sent or received for 24 hours.  Email that
is personal and does not relate to the business topics you have identified
can be kept, discarded etc. at the employee's pleasure.  Each day there is a
backup made that will capture the email in those employees mailboxes.  After
24 hours, each employee is free to manage their email box as they deem
appropriate to the business needs (e.g. keep, discard).

     In addition, I discussed with the
Attorney General the following procedure for when an employee runs out of
hard disk space on his/her computer.  Again, I have not heard any
disagreement regarding this procedure.

    When an employee runs out of hard disk space
on their computer, it is an acceptable practice to copy files from their
hard disk to the network (where they will be backed up) and then delete
those copied files to make sufficient work space for the employee to work.

    Below are our recommendations for the text
of an email to all EPMI personnel in Portland.  Dan Dietrich has confirmed
that the IT backroom support for this policy is in place and that we may
implement today.  Please send me a copy of the email that you distribute.

    Thanks
    Gary

    Text for your email:

    This message will update employees on the
status of the California Attorney General's order regarding the preservation
of business information.  Please NOTE THE IMPORTANT POLICIES DESCRIBED
BELOW.

    We have negotiated procedures with the
California Attorney General's office allowing each of you to manage your
email and hard drive capacity while still preserving business information.


    Starting today, please implement the
following business information retention policies:

    (1) PERSONAL EMAIL: can be kept, discarded,
etc. at will.

    (2) BUSINESS EMAIL: do not delete any
business email sent or received for 24 hours.  This 24 hour delay will allow
the network to save a backup copy of the email.  After 24 hours, BUSINESS
EMAIL may be kept, discarded, etc. at will.

    (3) WORD PROCESSING FILES OR FILE FRAGMENTS:
do not delete any SAVED FILE or any FILE FRAGMENT.  This policy covers any
FILE or FILE FRAGMENT that you have saved on your hard disk or the network.

    (4) DATABASES: do not delete any information
in DATABASES.

    (5) EXCEL SPREADSHEETS: do not delete any
information in EXCEL SPREADSHEETS.

    (6) CALENDARS OR SCHEDULING PROGRAMS: do not
delete any information.

    (7) OTHER ELECTRONIC DATA: do not delete any
OTHER ELECTRONIC DATA.

    (8) HARD DRIVE CAPACITY: in the event that
you run out of disk space on your personal computer, you may copy files to
the network (where they will be backed up), then delete the files from your
personal computer to create the work space you need.  DO NOT DELETE ANY FILE
BEFORE YOU HAVE COPIED IT TO THE NETWORK.


    In our negotiations we have discovered no
reason to believe that Enron has been singled out for investigation by the
Attorney General.  We will update you as we learn more.

    Please respond promptly to this notice via
email.  Your email should state that you understand and intend to comply
with the important business information retention policies stated above.

		 Subject: Summer Purchase Agreement


Attached please find clean and marked copies of a revised Purchase and Sale
Agreement.  There are attached copies in WordPerfect 8.0 and in PDF.

Two matters require special mention:

First, we have been advised that the parties discussed a threshhold with
respect to the TGS stamp tax issue of $16 million.  Accordingly, we have
amended the definition of the Excluded Liability to limit it to the excess
of any TGS liability that would yield that amount proportionately to the
Company's ownership interest.

Second, we have noted that the bifurcation of the materiality standard
between materiality as a condition to close and materiality as a condition
to indemnification yields an inappropriate result in the case of the
representation in Section 5.14 dealing with material adverse changes.  It is
our intention to condition the Acquiror's obligation to close on an adverse
matter that is material to a Strategic Business Unit.  It was to indemnify
the Acquiror with respect to an undisclosed adverse matter that is material
to a Strategic Business Unit.  I was not our intention to indemnify the
Acquiror with respect to each $4 million change in each Business not covered
by the other representations.  Accordingly, we have, in the case of Section
5.14, limited the definition of Material Adverse Change to clause (i) of
that definition. <<Houston_284555_1.WPD>>  <<Houston_284243_1.WPD>>

Subject: 2001 Group Expenses

Guys, attached you will find a final cut on the ENA 2001 expense budget.  
Please review and make any adjustments to your existing plan that are 
appropriate to hit the net ENA target.  In order to stay flat year on year, I 
split the remaining positive variance equally across the groups.  As we had 
discussed earlier, these costs will not be allocated to the business units 
and will be tracked on the ENA income statement below the line and the 
accountability managed by each of you.  All outside variable costs, 
specifically related to specific deals, will be charged to the business units 
eg) outside legal and tax, outside technical expertise, facility costs, 
outside research support, incremental back and mid office support for 
specific asset management deals, specific entertainment, etc.  I look at this 
cost structure as the minimum capacity charge we need to operate our business 
and evaluate/manage our risks.

Wes, can you please  finalize the one page plan (expenses and headcount) for 
each group with these changes.



Regards
Delainey

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

Catherine Homsey"

Here are some options considering what you  have
said:
?
1)? We can do a full week of class from May 7 to  11.
?
2)? The second option is to split the  course over two weeks.
If you cannot possibly accomodate a full week of  training 
then we can try this.? We have done  this before and it has 
worked fairly well.? It would be like:
?
Week 1 (20 hours):? Feb 20-23, Tue-Fri,  12:00 to 5:00
Week 2 (20 hours):?  April 9-12, Mon-Thu, 12:00 to 5:00
?
These are the only two weeks that are available for Venkat  
to teach before May 7th date.? 
?
Please let me know if these would work.? I  look forward to 
hearing from you.?

Subject:  Genesis Park


Jeff, I've been meaning to corner you at one of the YPO functions to spend
a
minute discussing a couple of topics.  First and foremost, I wanted to
introduce Genesis Park which is a ""new economy"" investment company that's
been recently founded here in Houston by Paul Hobby, Fred Lummis, Steve
Gibson, Peter Shaper, Bruce Herzog and myself.  Paul and I were hoping to
have an opportunity to spend 30 minutes with you in the next few weeks to
describe in person what we're all about.  And to be clear, we're not
looking
for Enron money, we are raising money from private individuals.  We've
already met with Jay Fitzgerald and Steve Horn to establish the
Enron/Genesis business relationship.

I also wanted to get your views on Enron's approach to oil trading and
whether the Vitol Group presented an opportunity.  Frankly, I think Vitol
is
an excellent acquisition target although the success they've enjoyed in the
last year or two will make it a bit more difficult.  They have an
unbelievable franchise, but they also have some fundamental weaknesses
which
could be exploited to Enron's benefit.  I'm shooting in the dark here but
hopefully it's worth some discussion.

If you can free some time during this busy holiday period to meet, it would
be greatly appreciated.  Paul and I could come to your office, or possibly
you could come to our ""offices"" over on Hermann Park.  We're buying 17
acres
on Hermann Park adjacent to the Park Lane Towers which we plan to develop
into a technology park.  For the time being, we are officing in a high tech
shed on the property!

Please let me know.  Thanks/Neil.

Payables

Effective today, the responsibility for Accounts Payables has been moved to Global Strategic Sourcing under the leadership of George Wasaff.  He, along with the Accounts Payable team, is pleased to announce a number of system enhancements based on your valuable feedback.

Delegation of Authority 
iPayit now enables you to identify a delegate to code, review, or approve invoices on your behalf.  The system provides you with the flexibility to:
*  Identify a delegate as a coder, approver, or reviewer
*  Define the length of time that you would like to delegate your authority
*  Select whether the delegate will assume your approval amount, maintain their own approval amount, or assume a specific approval amount

Incorrect Company Code
Incorrect company code?  No problem!  The invoice will no longer return to Accounts Payable for correction before you are able to code the invoice.  iPayit enables you to select the correct company code and continue coding.

Additional Enhancements
*  In addition to Quick Forward, you can now Quick Approve invoices
*  Invoice comments can now be easily viewed from your in-box

Introducing iPayit
With so many new systems, you told us that it was easy to confuse Payables with iBuyit eProcurement.  To help clear up that confusion, we are pleased to announce that this new and improved version has a new name:  iPayit.  
*  To access iPayit, visit the iBuyit Portal or http://iPayit.enron.com.
*  Look for e-mail notifications from <mailto:ipayit@enron.com>.  

Sneak Peak
For a preview of the enhancements and how to use them, click on the link below:
http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/ipayitsyspres.ppt

This is just the beginning!  We have created a committee that is dedicated to improving the Accounts Payable process.  We hope to engage you in this effort and plan to actively seek your involvement and input.  We look forward to working with and hearing from you about future enhancements that will enable iPayit to play a valuable role in your invoice payment activities.

For invoice payment status please call the AP Call Center at (713) 853-7127 or toll free  (866) AP ENRON, or send an e-mail to <mailto:ipayit@enron.com>.

Dear Karen, 

Thank you again for including me in your group of finalists for the Enron Scholarship.  Enron's commitment to community service and education is most admirable, I and felt honored to be selected (particularly considering the other people chosen).  I even enjoyed the interview experience, mostly because of the neat interviewers.

I also appreciate the prompt replies to all correspondence, as well as the follow-up call this evening (even if the news was not quite what I wanted to hear).  It's great to see people ""doing it right"".  If you need any assistance with future events at UT, please don't hesitate to call.

"Mark the position is relatively straight forward. Enron Australia Finance 
Pty.Ltd.(EAF) trades Australian Power Derivatives under what is known as an 
exempt market declaration (safe harbour provision). There are a number of 
requirements to be met under this Declaration including a list 
""qualifications"" of the persons who can enter into a transaction. The only 
qualification likely to apply to a non- Australian resident is if  a party 
registered under the Declaration (such as EAF) reasonably believes  that the 
entity has tangible assets with a market value of at least AUD10M (USD6M). 

What happens if we contract with someone who does not have this asset level 
and none of the other tests apply? In all likelihood nothing. However, the 
Australian Regulator (ASIC) would expect EAF to have procedures in place 
aimed at compliance with the provisions of the Declaration. We are required 
to report annually on these procedures. We are also currently in discussions 
with ASIC aimed at extending our Declaration to all products traded through 
EOL in Australia. This is to ensure we are prepared should legislative 
changes eventuate next year requiring trading in all derivatives to be 
licenced. Any suggestion that we do not have procedures in place to ensure 
compliance with the intent of our current declaration would be of extreme 
concern to ASIC. They placed particular emphasis on our assurances that we 
are not going to be entering the ""retail"" market and will have procedures to 
ensure this occurs. 

In essence what am saying is that we need to be able to point to procedures 
to show we are taking reasonable steps to ensure that our counterparties meet 
the qualifications to trade power derivatives.  My concern is not with  
Australian companies - there are a number of tests that apply to them apart 
from just asset level.  Also we can handle them from here.But when a company 
appears on Tana's list that is say incorporated in the US and does not trade 
in Australia there seems no way of checking unless some assessment is  made 
of its asset level. I thought this was being done as per procedures developed 
(see procedures attached to following email).  

Rather than bounce emails between us can we arrange a brief phone discussion 
on this point?

Subject: EnronOnline access to Australian Power products

Thanks for dealing with Tana on these issues.  It is not entirely clear to me 
what you want the policy to be regarding which counterparties have access to 
Australian power products.  You probably already know that the EnronOnline 
people want every counterparty everywhere in the world to have access to 
every product unless Credit or Legal can justify restricting their access.  
Credit already performs a financial test on each counterparty to determine if 
they meet the CFTC Eligible Swap Participant requirements.  Unfortunately, 
that test is not as restrictive as the Australian tangible assets test.  It 
sounds like there should be a US$6 million tangible assets test applied by 
Credit before we give any counterparty access to Australian Power (this would 
be a total pain but certainly possible).  On the other hand, if you feel 
comfortable giving access to non-Australian counterparties  without that test 
being performed, we can do that, too.  Pleas let me know if we should ask 
Credit to start performing this test on all counterparties or if it should be 
limited to Australian entities.

a synthetic financing entity would acquire from E-Next an LLC which has as
its sole asset the right to a GE Turbine.  This structure is desirable to
us since it makes a cleaner break and we believe it is permitted by the PO.
We have also confirmed with our financing entity that it is a structure
which is acceptable to them in concept.  We would like to confirm with GE
that this would be acceptable to them and you will also find a form of
letter attached which would serve as GE's confirmation of that fact.  By a

"Thanks again!  This week I used your suggestion for moving that banner
that covers the toolbar on Juno Web.  It worked!  That means that I can
now access the on-line addresses that appear in Juno E-mail messages and
print them if I wish.  That is a BIG plus!

I made some more progress with the printer too.  It was not printing well
the reports from Quicken.  Last night I was able to discover that I had
to change the printer setting on Quicken because it was still looking for
the old printer!  Word found the new printer by itself so I erroneously
assumed Quicken would too.  I'm sure all of this is ""old hat"" to you, but
for me it is not and it is exciting when I have success.

I have my Lilliput Lane village set up on the hi fi in the family room
now.  I really like having them arranged like a village now that I have
enough to do that.

I wonder if your paper whites are blooming yet.  Yes, people do grow them

Subject: RE: Standby Charge decision by  CPUC



Yesterday the PUC defeated (3-2) on a party line vote the  proposed decision 
of Commissioner Bilas re interim policy on standby  charges.? Instead, the 
Commission approved Commissioner Wood's alternate,  which several parties 
(State Consumers, ORA, New Energy, Capstone, et al) had  protested.? My 
understanding is that Commr. Wood's alternate was approved  with no changes.? 
It agreed with utilities that standby charges should  not reflect diversity 
benefits of DG in distribution because none currently  exist.

This decision may have negative implications for the sharing  of grid 
benefits of DG with end use consumers and other distributed generators  who 
may provide them.

Best, 

Jay Morse, ORA "

Subject:	Grella depo summary & limitations issue

Richard,

I spoke to Paul Heath and he said the bankruptcy code tolls the running of
limitations, so long as time to file had not run prior to the filing of the
bankruptcy petition.  The code provides for a new, two-year limitations
period from the time the petition in bankruptcy is filed.  From our
conversation, it sounds like that was filed on 9/4/99, and we will then
expect to see Ben's suit filed by 9/4/01.

The attached is my summary of what I perceived as the key bullet points from
Grella's testimony with some page references.  I hope it's useful.

Dan

Cindy,

Yes, it's just around the corner and we have our very best program ever.
Our web site is up at

http://hsb.baylor.edu/html/martinj/festival2.html

check it out.  Actually, I was waiting for the final version of the program
from Sheridan to post it before getting in touch with you this week.  We
are planning on a room capacity group of 45-50 folks and are finalizing the
plans for entertainment for Friday and Saturday night on the riverwalk.
Bill is handling the arrangements this year and I'll pass this message on
to him as well.

Do you think we could get an Enron speaker for Saturday's luncheon?  Last
year was fabulous and would be hard to top but we'd like to try.  San
Antonio should be a bit easier on the speaker too.  Let me know what your
thoughts are on everything including the speaker.

Bill and I are leaving town Wed afternoon to go to a Harvard conference so
maybe we could talk before then.

We're getting excited and want to get you guys involved for it is your
personal (and financial) support that makes the conference really work.

John

"EPA Stormwater Phase II Regulations - Jim Peterson provided information to 
EES in response to an inquiry about the effect of the stormwater phase II 
regulations on military installations.

EPA Guidance on BACT for Combined Cycle Turbines -  Marc Phillips is 
preparing comments supporting EPA's guidance on BACT for combined cycle 
turbines. The document indicated that SCR may not always be required and that 
dry-low NOx controls may all that is required in some circumstances. Jeff 
Keeler is circulating the comments for internal review. Comments are due 
September 18.

TNRCC Houston Non-Attainment Regulations -  Marc Phillips is preparing 
comments on the proposed Houston non-attainment regulations. It is 
anticipated that the comments will generally support the Business Coalition 
for Clean Air (BCCA)  comments with some added technical issues raised. Ken 
Lay sits on the BCCA board and Mike Terraso and Rob Bradley sit on the 
coordinating committee.

Enron Proposed Ergonomic Program - Russell Tucker and Linda Adels (Corporate 
Wellness) began loading the proposed pilot ergo training and analysis 
programs on the employee computers that are to participate in the program 
evaluations. It was found that the computers in the Enron building are locked 
down so much that neither of the programs could be loaded, requiring a long 
process of EDS involvement to affect the loading process on several different 
LANs. No problems have been encountered in 3AC.

EES/Eli Lilly Project - Susan Worthen gave a presentation to Eli Lilly 
regarding the corporate EHS organization, policy and management system, and 
performance, as well as participate in discussions of our operating 
experience and procedures in a Q&A session.  Other Enron participants 
included Rick Wood (Enron Bldg Services Inc - a subsidiary of EES) and Dave 
Nutt (Corp environmental counsel). The presentation and discussions were in 
response to a 10 page EHS questionnaire Lilly submitted as part of a due 
diligence they are conducting prior to signing a multi-million dollar 
out-sourcing agreement with EES.

Annual EHS Report - Positive feedback is being received externally and 
internally on our first report.  It will go to press this week with copies 
anticipated the week of the 25th.  Requests for copies have been received (so 
far) from John Hardy, Kelly Kimberly, EES, and EGE&P.

New Hire Orientation - Angela Sprock (Orientation) has relinquished 5 minutes 
during the Vision and Values for the EHS/Corporate Responsibility info.  The 
panel for the booth is awaiting Kelly Kimberly's final approval.

Project INGA - ENA East/West - ENA is investigating a stock purchase of 
Ahlstrom Development Corporation's holdings in five coal fired facilities.  
Two of the facilities (ACE Generation Company and Mt. Poso Cogeneration 
Company) are located in California.  Three of the facilities (Panther Creek 
Partners, Inter-Power Ahlcon LP (Colver) and Gilberton Power Company) are 
located in Pennsylvania.  ENA has contracted RTP Environmental Associates to 
conduct the due diligence (fatal flaw) and site visits.  The site visits were 
conducted 9/5/00 - 9/8/00 for the California facilities and 9/12/00 - 9/15/00 
for the Pennsylvania facilities.  Don Stevens will be conducting the 
environmental review of RTP's report.  The commercial objective is to 
restructure the PPA.

Project Dragon - Asia - Don Stevens was requested to supply a revised copy of 
the environmental due diligence to the Enron's Bangkok, Thailand office.  The 
lenders engineers will be reviewing the report within the next two weeks.  
The lenders engineers will submit any questions regarding the acquisitions to 
Don Stevens for further discussion.

Project Crane - ENA - ENA is looking to acquire 100% of Daishowa Paper Mfg. 
Co. Ltd's forest products operations in Quebec City, Quebec, Canada, and in 
Port Angeles, Washington.  The assets include seven paper and board machines, 
four major pulping facilities and integrated utility systems, a sawmill, a 
chip handling facility and forestlands in Quebec and Maine. Wayne Mays ENA 
requested EHS review assistance . Don Stevens will review the due diligence 
report and submit comments to ENA.  The environmental due diligence was 
conducted by AGRA Simons Engineering Global Solutions.

EHS Intranet Site - Gavin Dillingham has been working on the EHS Intranet 
site. The current status of the site is that the elaboration document is 
being completed. The intention is to hand over the document to the Internet 
developers/architects by the 1st of October. They say it is possible to have 
a rough mock-up of the site by the middle of October. 

Compliance Calendar - Gavin Dillingham and Gary Allen have been in talks with 
DS&S about locating a Compliance Management Calendar, which will be a modular 
software program that will allow the addition of other EHS modules to this 
system such as audit software and Health and Safety tracking software. 

EHS Management System document - Gavin Dillingham is also working on the EHS 
Management System document. All the data for roles and responsibilities has 
been gathered and placed in the document, as well as the EHS Management 
Description document. Also, the latest EHS council charter, the latest 
organizational chart, the standardized forms and documents and the due 
diligence schematic have been added. Gavin Dillingham will be moving over to 
the 3AC on Monday, the 18th of September.

Environmental Disclosure:Stacey Bolton made a presentation to the TX PUC in 
their kickoff meeting for environmental disclosure.  A trader accompanied her 
in order to familiarize the desk with some of the overlapping issues between 
environmental  disclosure and the renewable energy program. Stacey filed two 
sets of comments with the PUC, and subsequently met with Chairman Wood, 
Commissioner Judy Walsh and Evan Roe (staffer to Commissioner Perlman) to 
discuss environmental reporting and the trading program.  Hap Boyd was also 
in the meeting.  We got nearly everything we wanted in the renewable energy 
protocol, except for emission data on the credit itself.  Stacey will 
continues to advocate this issue and try to find a forum to get emissions 
data included (due to bypassed emissions opportunities and it puts more value 
on cleaner renewable fuels like wind).

International Environmental Emergency Responders -  David Ronkainen gave Don 
Hawkins (corporate crisis response manager) a  list of International 
Responders, so that a decision could be made in regard to negotiating 
agreements.

Dabhol Community Relations Management - Henry Van met with Dabhol Community 
Relations Management and visited all the community projects (technical 
school, elementary school, horticulture project and jetty for fishing 
village) in relation to the offsite impacts of the oil leaks.  The 
communities did not express active concern.   

Spill Update - Ed Zuleta participated on the TR conference call on spills.  A 
summary was prepared and mailed to key personnel in HSE group.

Wheatland Power - Enron  (Gus Eghneim) submitted a petition to EPA Region 5 
to waive the stack testing requirements and rely on CEMS ( continuous 
emission monitoring) certification to demonstrate compliance.  If approved, 
the waiver will save Enron approximately $400,000.  The savings are realized 
by not operating the plant during a low demand period only for the purpose of 
conducting stack test.  In low demand period, plants operate at a huge loss.

Pipeline Safety Legislation - Jeff Keeler continues to actively participate 
in the GPG efforts in the House to get passage of a bill similar to the 
Senate bill passed last week.

MTBE Legislation - Jeff Keeler continues to follow the progress and advocates 
including a transition costs to a new production process if a rider is placed 
on an appropriations bill.

Environmental Product Strategy Meeting -  Stacey Bolton has organized a 
meeting with business units involved or interested in pursuing various 
opportunities arising from environmental policies, such as renewables, energy 
efficiency, and green power marketing.   Representatives of EES, ENA 
Origination, ENA West Desk, Enron Wind, and Enron Global Markets will be in 
attendance.  Stacey and Mary Schoen will present updates on environmental 
regulations and incentives for green power oppportunities.  They will also 
foster discussion among businesses about upcoming bids/commercial partnering 
opportunities, evolving markets for renewable credit trading, and potential 
product offerings.  This meeting is aimed at adding value and creating 
business opportunities for the Enron busniess units.

Pipeline safety legislation -  Jeff Keeler is working with members of 
Congress and others in industry on a strategy that would get the House of 
Representatives to pass the pipeline safety legislation recently passed by 
the Senate.  This strategy avoids several procedural steps in Congress and 
allows the House to pass a bill that is fairly acceptable to industry, rather 
than waiting for the House to produce its own bill and move it 
independently.   This is a very fluid situation right now, but we hope to 
have a positive result by next week.

MTBE legislation -   the Senate Environment Committee passed MTBE legislation 
last week, containing a number of provisions that are bad for MTBE producers, 
including a ban of MTBE, granting states the ability to waive the fuel oxygen 
standard, and mandating increased ethanol use over 10 years.   Two Enron 
amendments were voted on -- liability protection and an MTBE producer 
""transition retrofit fund"" -- and defeated, but Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison 
received a commitment that transition fund issue would be addressed before 
the bill moves on to the Senate floor.   Jeff will be working on this issue 
with Senate staff over the next few weeks.

TVA environmental litigation - we supported the Enron Global Markets 
emissions/coal desk in getting information on TVA's appeal of lawsuits by EPA 
on violations of New Source Review rules.  A is expected by an EPA 
Administrative Appeals Board on 9/15, in which TVA will likely lose.  TVA is 
appealing in Federal Court, arguments to be held in early November.   
Intelligence on this is extremely important to several Enron business units, 
as much of the electric utililty industry is watching to see whether EPA can 
prevail in its enforcement activities against coal plants, and utilities' 
future decisions about fuel choice, control technologies, etc. could be 
affected by action in this case.

EPA enforcement activities- we have learned that EPA is now targeting 14 
non-utility, coal-fired boilers in Pennsylvania for New Source Review 
enforcement.  We will be providing more detailed information to traders that 
could find opportunities from this action, as well as Enron originators 
currently working on acquisition of several QF coal assets in Pennsylvania.

TX Disclosure -  Stacey Bolton made a presentation to the TX PUC in their 
kickoff meeting for environmental disclosure, in which Enron power traders 
also participated to gain insights on the relationship between the disclosure 
and renewable energy trading programs.   Stacey also filed two sets of 
comments w/ the PUC, and subsequently met w/Chairman Wood, Commissioner Judy 
Walsh and Evan Roe (staffer to Commissioner Perlman) to discuss environmental 
reporting and the trading program.  Enron Wind was also involved in these 
meetings.  Enron got nearly everything we wanted in the renewable energy 
protocol, except for putting emissions data on the credit itself -- which is 
an issue Stacey will continue to pursue in TX and other states.

Pew Center symposium on Climate Change - Mary Schoen will be representing 
Enron in a Pew Center symposium on climate change in New Orleans on Thursday 
9/21.   Members of industry, government and environmental groups will be in 
attendance, and Mary's panel will be discussing what businesses are doing 
about climate change.

 America's Clean Air Celebration - Enron will be honored next week at 
America's Clean Air Celebration, a dinner put on in conjunction with the 
Hart/IRI World Fuels Conference in Washington, D.C.   Enron and Ken Lay will 
be presented with an award recognizing excellence in energy, environment and 
innovation, which Jeff Keeler will accept and present remarks following.   
Other participants are BP/Amoco, Texaco, GM and a number of other industry 
peers.   President George Bush and Senator George Mitchell are co-chairs of 
the event -- Bush will make videotaped remarks including a mention of Ken 
Lay's contribution to clean air, and Mitchell will MC the event.

Kevin,

How are things going?  Don't imagine you are too upset not having to deal 
with California or the wildfires out west?  Things are going well for us 
here, but as we expected it is like the US in 94/95 (things just starting) 
and Europe (96/97).  The Japanese utilities are not being too original in 
their approach... same playbook.  Regardless of all of this, looking at sites 
and potential development of physical trading assets is starting to look 
quite promising.  Jpnese cutting back on nuclear and significantly increasing 
LNG and many old oil-fired plants out there are just a few of the 
characteristics.

You mentioned in your last email that you had significantly reduced your 
efforts at adding capacity in the East.  Along these lines would you know of 
anyone that might be interested in a Japan tour to get all of this going?  
Ideally it would be someone at the Director level.  Let me know.

Joe

I would reword the first sentence as follows:

In response to your e-mail dated March 21st and based on all of the 
information that we have received from you thus far which essentially has 
only demonstrated that the debt of our Reference Entity's affiliates has been 
repudiated, we still lack proof of the repudiation by our Reference Entity 
(and the guarantor of such debt) of its obligations under the Guaranty that 
supports such debt.  Please provide us such information to demonstrate that a 
Credit Event has occurred.

I will be out of the office tomorrow but will be checking my voice mail.  If

I have stranded all the transport to the border out of Keystone for the month of December.

The transport volumes that have been taken out are as follows:

	22,836 - Keystone  -->  Socal Ehrenburg

	11,418 - Keystone  -->  Socal Ehrenburg (this is the mexican de cobra deal).  Previously Mexican de Cobra was buying the gas from Texaco.  Starting in 					December, Mexican will have to find another supply for this gas.  They will no longer buy from Texaco.  Phil Polsky is talking with 					Mexican, and a deal will be entered into Sitara, once Mexican has found a supply.

NGI's Daily Gas Price Index 
Breaking News : posted Oct 2, 9:35 AM
El Paso's Offshore Pipe From Nova Scotia To NY On Track 
El Paso Corp. said Tuesday that because of increased drilling activity near Sable Island, it is on track to develop a $1.6 billion pipeline to transport natural gas supplies off the coast of Nova Scotia to markets in Canada and the northeastern part of the United States. The proposed Blue Atlantic Transmission System, anticipated to be in service by the fourth quarter of 2005, would be 750 miles long, and its 36-inch pipe would carry up to 1 Bcf/d along a subsea route from the southern coast of Nova Scotia to landing points in New York and New Jersey. 
Noting that El Paso was pleased with the initial feasibility study, E. Jay Holm, CEO of El Paso Eastern Pipeline Group, said the company was ""confident"" it could develop an effective plan. 
Meanwhile, Maritimes & Northeast Pipeline, the only existing system from offshore Nova Scotia to New England, has embarked on its own major expansion program designed to increase capacity on its system to 2 Bcf from 500 MMcf/d by 2010. The Scotian Shelf currently has proven reserves of more than 6 Tcf, but experts believe it could contain 10 times that amount. 
El Paso clearly has its eyes set on some of those volumes, but it will have battle with Maritimes, which already has commitments from the Sable Offshore Energy Project and PanCanadian Petroleum. 
""The subsea configuration offers several advantages over a land-based alternative,"" said Holm, ""including minimal environmental impact, significant reduction in community disturbances, and anticipated transportation routes substantially less than $1 a dekatherm for firm deliveries to the New York and New Jersey markets, as well as reduced rates for deliveries to the province of Nova Scotia."" 
Holm said that the ""anticipated rates are significantly less than that of any known current or proposed alternative project to provide firm transportation to these regions."" 
Blue Atlantic would offer economic benefits to Nova Scotia by creating the first access to natural gas in the province's southwestern region and would address the ""continuing increasing demand"" for natural gas along the U.S. East Coast, said El Paso. Natural gas demand along the East Coast is expected to increase an additional 685 MMcf/d by 2005, and will grow to an incremental 2 Bcf/d by the end of the decade. 
El Paso plans to open an office in Halifax and has already retained Halifax-based Jacques Whitford Environment Ltd. as well as U.S.-based ENSR Corp. to begin the environmental work. Also, El Paso is evaluating bids on providing overall project management services to assist in siting and design of the pipe and related facilities. 
Soon, El Paso plans to enter into negotiations with potential shippers and conduct an open season to determine capacity demands before the end of this year. It also is seeking input from various regulatory and government organizations, and is working with local communities involved and special interest groups to ensure issues are addressed about the project. 
""This is an ambitious project and our goal is to identify various stakeholders and involve them during all phases of the development process,"" said Holm. 
When the route has been selected, Blue Atlantic will proceed with obtaining the necessary approvals from both Canadian and U.S. regulatory officials, and El Paso said it expects filings will begin by the end of 2002.

Subject: Final Commission Decision on Rate Design

At the continuation meeting held this afternoon, the Commission voted out
the Alternate Proposed Decision on SCE/PG&E rate design.  The vote was 3 to
2, with Bilas and Duque voting ""no"".

Absent a close reading (which I have not had the opportunity to do yet), it
is difficult to discern all the changes made to the alternate as it was not
put out in a red-lined form.  While the version voted out today contains a
lot more verbiage supporting the previously made resolutions of the issues,
the only real substantive changes made appear to be (1) it lowers the cap on
agricultural customers rate increases from 30% to 20% for agricultural TOU
customers, and to 15% for agricultural non-TOU customers; and (2) it places
an average rate increase cap on industrial customers.  For PG&E, this
average rate increase cap is 12.3 cents/kWh; for SCE its $12.9 cents/kWh.
The decision does not contain alot of explanation on the industrial cap.  I
am assuming that the ""average rate increase"" refers to the average across
TOU periods.

I will review the Decision more closely, providing a complete summary
tomorrow.  In the mean time, if you have any questions, please call.

The sheet labelled 'Daily Change' shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in

the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using the previous day's
volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current gas day is 3/28, then
the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for 3/28).  For
tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the change is computed using
the First-of-the-month volumes requested for those days.  (e.g., If today is
3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect to the

Sorry that you did not receive my e-mail of Sept. 9th with the attached
addendum.  We have reviewed the draft of the Enfolio Master Firm
Purchase/Sales Agreement and find it generally to be a good agreement.  The
attached file contains an addendum with three changes that we would like to
make to the contract.  The first item is merely a grammatical clarification.
The second relates to the fact that we typically do not get the annual
report out within 120 days.  This year, we got it out in about 180 days.
The third item relates to a requirement that we must follow as a municipal
corporation.

Although the purchase process has not yet been approved by executive
management, we wanted to get the contractual issues resolved so that the
agreement could be immediately put in place once the approval occurs.
Please do not hesitate to contact me at (210)353-3725 if you have an

"Hi Vince and Happy New Year
Good to hear from you and I can understand being busy. I am myself trying to
balance my commitments here.

Like any research consortium Pserc is trying to provide value to its members
while walking the fine line between cooperation and competition. We are
definitely not in the business of providing proprietary research to the
members but rather working on more generic areas that later individual
members could see way to convert to proprietary tools. The work that Shijie
Deng and Rajnish Kamat have been doing with me are good examples.

As to my trip, thanks for the invitation but I already committed myself to
get back Friday night so I will save my visit for another time.

I will tell my son about the spring interviews at Cornell. Hopefully this

Steve,   As we just discussed, this is the transition memo suggesting that  
you place a call to Clay Johnson.   As noted in the memo, we are still 
working through with the lawyers what leave status our employees would be 
required to take while serving on the private transition and the publicly 
funded transition.  The answer to this question may determine their 
willingness to serve, in some cases.

Louise,

Here's what we've got. This list of MTM values is based on a list of prepay deals #'s from Greg Whiting and shows value as of COB 22 Nov 01.

Global Finance has the rest of the details we need to complete the picture. 

Give me a call if you need more.

"Hi Sara,

How are you going - did you have a good Thanksgiving?  Coincidentally 
Thursday was also a holiday here - we were celebrating Respect for the Aged 
Day though.

Actually, Sara, I was wondering how we are going in getting some drafting 
together for the credit provisions discussed recently with John Suttle and 
Jonathan Whitehead.

Thanks and sorry for the trouble.

If you have time in the morning (Nov. 9 Tokyo), I would like to discuss ENA's 
view of the CSA/Schedule relationship.  In a nutshell, we provide that a 
ratings downgrade is an Additional Event of Default in the Schedule (normally 
a MAC in the CSA).  John's preferance, of course, would be a unilateral event 
triggering an IBJ default (which I am sure would be difficult to negotiate).

I am not certain of the time difference but perhaps you could call me at the 
office after 4 pm (Nov.8 in Houston) and I could then conference in John.  
Alternatively, please feel free to contact me at home (after 7 pm Houston 
time on Nov. 8) at 713-664-3207.

I look forward to hearing from you.  Regards.  Sara

		 Subject: IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT - 1. Credit matrix and 2. Threshold 
amount 

Dear John,

Jonathan and I met with IBJ today to try and push our negotiations through to 
the end.  They are still unwilling to do a CSA with us but very significantly 
their back / mid office is currently looking at getting systems support in 
place which would permit them to do a CSA with us in due course.  They 
acknowledged to us of their own volition that the market trend is towards 
CSAs even in transactions where the counter party is not a bank.  They did 
say though that it would be a few months before they would be set up to do 
so. Pls note that they did not agree to do a CSA with us as soon as they are 
set up to do so but they now know we will come knocking at some stage to ask 
them to do it so I think we have gone as far as we can on this for now.

We will therefore move forward on the credit matrix in the meantime, if you 
are still willing to do so.  The bank has a credit rating of A, so I guess 
this means US$15 million credit limit.  

On the assumption that it is possible to draft these terms into a contract 
without a full CSA, I wonder who is best to do this drafting.  I should be 
able to do the negotiations but I am not sure that I am able to do the 
drafting .... Alan, do you have any suggestions?     

Most of the other issues are sorted now but they still want to change the 
""Threshold Amount"" definition to US$10 million.  Is there any flexibility on 
this?

Thanks.

Jane McBride

		 Subject: Re: Fw: IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT

Jonathan,

One thing we might be able to propose is a ""Credit Matrix"" which prescribes a 
Credit Line under which each counterparty can transact - with collateral 
rights and collateral thresholds tied to the credit rating of each 
counterparty.  We have used credit matrixes in several contracts here and 
they are appealing in that there are no Material Adverse Change (MAC) 
clauses.  This is appealing to the counterparty in that we cannot 
automatically drop their collateral threshold to zero when a MAC occurs.  We 
are comfortable because as the counterparty's credit quality deteriorates, 
the amount of exposure to which we are subject decreases.  I would propose to 
IBJ something like the following in lieu of a full CSA.  Jane and John - is 
it possible to draft these collateral/credit terms into the contract without 
using a full CSA?  (I think every matrix I have used here has been part of a 
CSA).

Rating (S&P)     Credit Line
AA or above    $20MM
BBB+ to AA-    $15MM
BBB     $10MM
BBB-     $7MM
BB- to BB+    $5MM
Below BB-    $1MM

These terms are subject to negotiation.  Once again, the matrix removes MAC 
clauses and the stress counterparties associate with such, but effectively 
reduces the potential exposure we have (or THEY have) to a counterparty with 
diminishing credit quality.

What do you all think?

John

Subject: Re: Fw: IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT  

Sorry, Pressed send too early:

John, Have had a conversation with IBJ re the CSA, and they have asked us to 
consider proposing a solution that does not involve a CSA. I propose to meet 
with them again to try and explore why, but I would like to be prepared to 
offer them a solution whereby we don't enter into a CSA, and we would limit 
the types of trades that we could enter into with IBJ. My feeling is that we 
would be unlikely to enter into any long term transactions (over 2 years) at 
this stage anyway, and would prefer to get the relationship going, as I am 
not sure they are going to budge on this issue yet. They appear to be quite 
willing to discuss all the other points. We can always press for a 
renegotiation at a later stage if we do want to enter into longer term deals. 
I also want to keep the loan facility completely separate.

What are your thoughts on this, and what limitations would you want to put on 
trades if we do not have a CSA?

Thanks,
Jonathan

John-

During our last meeting with IBJ, we pushed hard for the implementation of 
the CSA.  I believe that they have the systems capability to handle the 
requisite activities relating to the CSA, as we understand that they utilize 
same with certain financial institution counterparties.  We expressed our 
view on these matters and also raised other issues that we had discussed in 
our recent conference call.  

IBJ informed us that they have never entered into a CSA with a non-financial 
institution counterparty and my response was that Enron can then be the 
first.  We requested that they raise this issue with their respective 
superiors.  As you know, their response to our discussions relating to this 
issue was ""In terms of CSA, as we are not ready for running collateral 
operations, we still do not prefer to use the CSA.""  The legitimacy of this 
statement is certainly debatable and the underlying reason may actually be 
something entirely different, including the possibility that they merely do 
not want to enter into a CSA with a non-financial institution.  

We will continue to attempt to persuade IBJ to enter into the CSA with Enron, 
however it is uncertain if this is achievable.

"Hello traders!

This e-mail is a request regarding counterparties EES and MPC.

Please pay careful attention to the columns from which you are pulling MW and 
price information when you build the worksheet that we send to EES.  We have 
had some recent discrepancies that could have been avoided if the correct 
information had been sent to EES. 

Also, our checkouts with Montana Power Company are getting out of control.  
We are off with them 9 days, totaling 19 deals for the month of February.  
Many of these discrepancies are from deals that were spoken, but not recorded 
in Enpower nor in the INC sheets.  I understand that we do many deals a day 
with MPC and a few may go un-recorded, but it's getting to be too many.  
Please remember to at least put these deals in your log and in the INC sheets.

One final request is that you state the hour when you make trades by phone.  
Tapes are irrelevant if we play them for the counterparty and there is no 
hour stated.  It also makes it difficult for us to pull tapes when necessary. 

Thanks for your responses to my requests in the past.  If you have any 
questions regarding any of the above, please come see me.

Thanks,

"Since no one in your group could locate these guys either, I suggest that you have this type of information in RAC for every authorized signatory and their back-ups. This information needs to be available and communicated to all folks that are responsible for DASH signatures. If there is ever another situation where people are not available at any given time to sign a DASH, I want RAC to have a back-up plan in place. I'm holding RAC responsible for ensuring this process works. Once this DASH process has been fully vetted-including adding Whalley and Frevert, and the back-up plan in place- I want to have your folks working with EES and our Deal Management leads in a room to review the process and ensure everyone understands it.

I appreciate you e-mail.  I will send an Executive Directory down to you.  It has my home #, cell #, and pager # in it.  I carry my cell phone and pager all the time and leave them on at night.  Also, I check my e-mail every day, even when on the road.  My e-mail address is:  andrew.fastow@enron.com.  Also, I have given Cheryl Lipschutz authority to sign for Ben or me on any DASHes, if we are unavailable.  Since she works for you, I'm sure you know that she has cell phones, pagers, etc. (and could have been reached all last week that way as well).

In this case, it sounds as simple as an administrative assistant not following through and your deal person not figuring out how to make direct contact.  As a result, your e-mail is perplexing.  If there is a different issue that we need to discuss, please let me know.  If not, I agree that discussion of this issue is now out of proportion and hopefully we can avoid it in the future.

They took the DASH to Ben Glisan on Thursday. He left Thursday pm and his Assistant never gave him the DASH. They tried contacting both you and Ben on Friday and apparently your Assistants were not here either. Cheryl Lipshutz had already given her approval and Trushar was executing on their behalf. I even had them look for Joe Deffner and he wasn't here either. Rick Buy was not here. I talked with Jay Hatchen/Dave Gorte and asked them to sign off for Corp. Finance given the situation. 

Andy, don't blow this out of proportion. I've asked Rick Buy in the past to create some sort of back-up approvals when we have situations like this come up. This isn't specifically about Corp. Finance, it happens from time to time with all signatory groups. You know how customers/deals are, sometimes they don't completely come together until just before execution. We just have to figure out a way to manage it.

RAC is responsible for all corporate DASH's-and this process- so I think they need to recommend a process with back-up approvals which we can all buy off on. 

And yes, you're right, I also should have called you directly.

Just to be sure you're in the loop here, no one in Finance was available to sign this DASH last week. Not Fastow, not Glisan, their Assistants weren't in. Deffner wasn't here. Lipshutz wasn't here. etc, etc, etc. I told Hatchen, Gorte to represent Corp. Finance and Gorte gave verbal OK. We still haven't been able to get Fastow and Glisan to sign the DASH (I think they're back tomorrow). Deal is done and executed.

This is too difficult for someone in our Deal Management group to facilitate through our system. Maybe we need to give back-up authority to RAC for approvals in a situation like this. This may be a topic for our offsite on Friday.

On May 3, 2001 the PIBA Environmental Product Strategies Committee and the
Environmental Action Committee are hosting a joint meeting from 8:00am-12pm
- Hewlett Packard, 3215 Porter Drive, Palo Alto, Bldg. 15, ""Insead"" Room.
Directions available at PIBA.org web site

CHAIRS: Christine Kohl-Zaugg, CH2M Hill; and Ed Quevedo, WSP Environmental
North America; Jenny Portera,
 EORM; and Ron Vitug, Turner Construction
 BD.LIAISON:     Greg Chambers, Quantum Corporation
 TOPIC:              Power For the Valley: Energy Management Risks and
Solutions
 SPEAKERS:     Lynne Jimenez, KGO-Radio; Ken Perkins, Shaklee; Bob
Thurmand, Cisco Systems; Mary Tucker, City of San Jose; and Bill Smith,
EPRI.

? REGISTRATION will be held from 7:30-7:50am.  The meeting will start at
8:00am.
? NON MEMBER CHARGE: $95.00 (Cash, Check, or Visa/MC) 50% discount to SVMG
members.

As the California energy crisis has deepened, organizations of all kinds
are struggling to keep ahead of energy management operating and planning
risks.  This 
 day workshop will focus on Successes and Failures of the
current energy management infrastructure, and will deliver some best
practices and practical planning solutions which organizations can employ
today to improve their energy management strategies.  Unlike other sessions
and conferences on this important topic, our session will be
practice-based, deliver usable tools, and provide you with a chance to put
your questions directly to experts and colleagues who have dealt with the
challenges of the Energy Shortage on the front lines.

We will open with an interactive session on energy sources, selection, and
""how we got here.""  We expect this session will be led by Lynne Jimenez of
KGO-Radio.

We will then have a one-hour session on Best Practices in designing
buildings to avoid energy crises.  This discussion will include Ken Perkins
of Shaklee, and a second private sector building operator.

Our third session will focus on Breakdowns in the permitting and energy
sourcing and approval process, with Bob Thurmond from Cisco Systems and
Mary Tucker from the City of San Jose.

We will close with a roundtable discussion of Solutions and the Road
Forward, to include representatives of the City of Santa Clara, the League
of Women Voters, and Bill Smith from EPRI.  Ms. Jimenez will facilitate
this closing session.

them in her basket, hesitated, and then put them back. ?She ?turned to go 
and ?once again reached for the pack of steaks. 

She saw me watching her and she smiled. ?""My husband loves T-bones, but 
honestly, at these prices, I don't know."" 

I swallowed the emotion down my throat and met her ?pale blue eyes. ?""My 
husband passed away eight days ago,"" I told her. ?Glancing at the package 
in 
her hands, I fought to control the tremble in my voice. ?""Buy him the 
steaks. ??And cherish every moment you have together."" 

She shook her head and I saw the emotion in her eyes as she placed the 
package in her basket and wheeled away. 

I turned and pushed my cart across the length of ?the store to the dairy 
products. ?There I stood, trying to decide which ?size milk I should buy. 
A 

quart, I finally decided and moved on to the ice cream section near ?the 
front ?of the store. ?If nothing else, I could always fix myself an ?ice 
cream cone. 

I placed the ice cream in my cart and looked down ?the aisle toward the 
front. 

I saw first the green suit, then recognized the ?pretty lady coming 
towards 
?me. ?In her arms she carried a package. ?On her ?face was the  
brightest 
smile ?I had ever seen. ?I would swear a soft halo encircled her ?blond 
hair 

as she ?kept walking toward me, her eyes holding mine. ?As she ?came 
closer, 

I saw ??what she held and tears began misting in my eyes. 

""These are for you,"" she said and placed three ?beautiful long stemmed 
yellow ?roses in my arms. ?""When you go through the line, ?they will know 
these are ??paid for."" She leaned over and placed a gentle ?kiss on my 
cheek, then smiled ?again. 

I wanted to tell her what she'd done, what the ?roses meant, but still 
unable ?to speak, I watched as she walked away as tears clouded my 
vision. 
I 
looked ?down at the beautiful roses nestled in the green ?tissue  
wrapping 
and found ?it ??almost unreal. ?How did she know? ?Suddenly the ?answer 
seemed so clear. ?I ?wasn't alone. 

?""Oh, Rudy, you haven't forgotten me, have you? ?I ?whispered, with 
tears 
in ?my ??eyes. ?He was still with me, and she was his angel. 

?Everyday be thankful for what you have and who you ?are. ?Please read 
all 

of this, it is really nice. This is a simple request. ?If ?you appreciate 
life, send this to your friends, ?including the person that ?sent it to 
you. 
Even though I clutch my blanket and growl when the ?alarm ?rings,thank 
you, 

Lord, that I can hear. ?There are many who are deaf. ?Even though I keep 
my 

eyes closed against ?the ?morning light as long as ?possible, thank you, 
Lord, that I can see. ?Many are blind. 

?Even though I huddle in my bed and put off rising, ?thank you, Lord, 
that 

I ??have the strength to rise. ??There are many who are bedridden. 

?Even though the first hour of my day is hectic, when socks are lost, 
toast 
is ??burned and tempers are short, my children are so ?loud, thank ?you, 
Lord, for ?my family. ?There are many who are lonely. ?Even though our 
breakfast table never looks like ?the pictures in ?magazines ??and the 
menu 
is at times unbalanced, thank ?you,Lord, for the ?food we have. ??There 
are 
many who are hungry. ?Even though the routine of ?my job often is 
monotonous, thank you, Lord, for ?the opportunity to ?work. ?There are 
many 
who have no job. ??Even though I grumble and bemoan ?my fate from day ?to 
day 
and wish my ??circumstances were not so modest, ?thank you, Lord, ?for 
life. 

Pass this on to the friends you know, it ?might ?help a bit to make this 
world ?a better place to live, right? 

PASS IT ON....

Carol,

In response to the comments PanCanadian has with out ISDA;

1)  I can live with excluding obligations with Affilates, if it is defined 
this way in the Canadian Master.  Although I would like to know your thoughts 
on this.

2) The Minimum Transfer amount must remain ar $1.00

3) I can agree to the rounding of $100,000 for both counterparty's.

4) I will agree to the L/C Bank to be either a major US or Canadian Bank.

5) I can not remove the current ratio trigger, this company is a marketing 
company with large current assets and liabilities and this is a way to 
monitor the company's balance of receivables to payables.

Please call with questions

Russell

Subject: PanCanadian's Credit Comments

Russell:
Here are the credit related comments that Pancanadian Energy Services Inc. 
made 

1. They want the definition of Specified Indebtedness to exclude obligations 
with Affiliates.  This is how it is defined in the Canadian Master.

2. They want a Minimum Transfer Amount for each of us of $100,000.

3. They want rounding to be reduced to $100,000 for each of us.

4. In the definition of Letter of Credit, they want the LC Bank to either be 
a major US or Canadian Bank, but not a foreign bank with a US branch office.

5. In the definition of Material Adverse Change, they want to delete the 
Current assets/Current Liabilities ratio trigger.

"Group,

On April 27th and 28th there will be a training class offered in Portland, 
Oregon with two spots available.  The course is Electric System Operation for 
the Non-engineer.  The course highlights include:
Generation
Transmission and Overhead
Distribution Systems
Underground Distribution
Switchgear
Voltage Control
Matching Generation

The course will purportedly provide a comprehensive understanding of system 
operations including fossil fuel, hydro and nuclear generation, transmission 
and distribution.  The course should provide not only technical information 
but also economics of operation, system and equipment protection and safety.
I will be taking the class along with two members of the real-time group.  If 
this is a useful class (as it appears to be) we will have the opportunity to 
attend it again later this year.  If you are interested in attending this 
class on these dates please let me know as soon as possible. 

Thanks,

We are waiting for Mark Greenberg to finalize the negotiations on the amendment to the online ETA for DB.  We would like to shut down BT from all financial trading.  However, what we found was that DB will not execute the online ETA without some revisions.  Mark is negotiating an amendment to the ETA with DB.  Meanwhile, BT had already been trading online.  Since that cat was already out of the bag so to speak, DB didn't want to shut them down from trading without having another avenue to trade, so we are continuing to trade as BT.  We do not want to do this FOREVER, HOWEVER, so we do need to get BT SHUT DOWN.

HOW GOES IT MARK????

Howdy.  Can one of you guys remind me where we stand with this sort-of merged counterparty?
Last I recall while DB had bought BT, BT was still allowed to transact in its name - because we
hadn't yet renegotiated an ISDA for the combined entity.  Is that still where we stand?  

HELP!!!!

Our first Gray-outs: These power outages are purely a failure of leadership


(Published March 21, 2001) 
Add a new term to the electricity nomenclature -- the Gray-out. This is a 
power outage caused by politics in Sacramento under Gov. Gray Davis, rather 
than some unavoidable mismatch between supply and demand.

This is March. Peak demand is thousands upon thousands of megawatts lower 
than it will be this summer. And yet the lights are going out.

These rolling Gray-outs trace squarely back to state government's failure to 
figure out a way to pay for all the power that California needs. The 
generators who aren't getting paid are beginning to go temporarily out of 
business. Day by day, less and less power is available for the grid, to the 
point that a little bit of spring sun is enough to overtax supply and turn 
out the lights. Unbelievable.

It's true that the governor is bleeding the state's coffers to the tune of 
about $50 million every day to pay the big for-profit generators for their 
supply. This is his short-term solution, until the longer-term solution -- 
whatever that is -- kicks in. But no, even that huge payment isn't all the 
money needed to pay all the generators.

Neglected by the government plan are about 600 little guys that produce 20 
percent of the electricity supply. These are generators dotted throughout the 
state known as Qualifying Facilities. A creation of the alternative energy 
movement of the 1970s, these are plants powered by natural gas, the sun and 
the wind. Unlike the big for-profit generating companies, these QFs are 
contractually tied to the giant utilities, Southern California Edison and 
PG&E. And the utilities haven't been paying them for weeks and weeks -- at 
this point the QFs are owed $1.48 billion.

Not surprisingly, some of these generators can't afford to keep producing 
power for free. Grid operators say that these QFs could be producing about 
6,000 megawatts if they were being paid. Instead, they are producing about 
3,100, and the amount is decreasing. Outages were triggered on Monday because 
the grid was short about 1,000 megawatts of load. This math clearly reveals 
how avoidable this disruption was. Call it a rolling Gray-out.

Bipartisan legislation has languished in Sacramento for weeks that would cut 
in half what these QFs have been billing the utilities. The savings are 
possible by moving these contracts into long-term deals and out of the 
higher-priced spot market. This piece of the overall solution has been 
stalled while the governor has been at work on the others, such as returning 
the big utilities to solvency and locking in power purchases long-term with 
the big for-profit generators. Disregarding the little guys, however, is a 
mistake that the governor and Legislature should correct immediately.

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

Katarzyna Lesinski"

"Hello Mike,

It has been a while since my last communication with you. I hope all is well.

I want you to know that I greatly appreciated you helping me get in touch 
with Ken Rice and all of the other folks at EBS last year. We made great 
strides and came very close to doing a deal between our organizations. 
However, Comdisco recently has come under some financial duress and is most 
likely going to be sold off in pieces.

I have been talking with some of the folks within EBS about the possibility 
of an origination position with their group. However, I am of the opinion 
that EBS is slightly ahead of the market, and therefore the timing may not be 
right for me to consider an origination position with EBS.

With that being said, I would be very interested in exploring what 
opportunities might exist within your Global Markets group from an 
origination standpoint. As you know, I am professionally aggressive, mentally 
tough and fearless of contacting potential clients. I have solid experience 
in professional selling, possess excellent communication and entrepreneurial 
skills.

Mike please consider the attached resume below. I would welcome the 
opportunity to meet with you or the appropriate person within your 
organization at any time.

Thanks again, and I hope to hear from you.

Let's begin rolling out the cash products at 7:15 am.  We should also get 
back to the cash strategy of the desk each morning.  Let's start testing the 
market, find the support and resistance each day.  It would be nice to have 
EOL change the stack manager so that we can switch a product from manage 
market depth to last trade is mid with the click of a button, and not go 
through the product properties.  I'll call them tomorrow.

Let's also decide on a time to close the products each morning.  We want to 
send the message of reliability, but also allow our Ops group to balance and 
nom.  I want to begin trading the next day cash by 11:01 am every day.  This 
would stay active until 4:00.

The push is for PHYSICAL.  Our edge over the market will be phys.  From risk 
to the ability to nominate and invoice, the other platforms will never see it 
coming. What are the chances that ICE and espeed will deal with el paso 
flows?  If information is the reason for EOL, then this will provide it.  It 
all seems so simple - Fixed priced physical, just when you thought it was old 
economy.  The reliable indices to big position trading to EOL market share, 
all benefit under the new mantra.

"I have prepared a mirror deal between HPL Supply Co and ENA for the Entex 
deals on the Sales List.  In talking with Gary Lamphier the deals with Shell 
Oil Company and with Valero Marketing have not been signed by the 
counterparties and he intends to get them to sign them after he does his next 
deal with them.  Therefore those deals have not been finally papered.  Ed 
Gottlieb is supposed to be having someone pull the ENA deals that are to be 
included with project triple lutz so that a determination can be made of 
whether someone is to contact those parties for permission to include copies 
in the data room, possible assignment to a dummy company which can be 
included in project triple lutz, or treated as the Entex deals by creating a 
back to back between HPL Supply Co and ENA.  So far Ed has not provided me 
any information. Please call if you have any questions.

Attached are the files that I received to use in pulling the contracts for 
the Data Room.  I was never given any lists of just the top 10 
purchase/sales/transportation customers.  I believe that those lists were 
used to come up with the contract lists that I was given and that those 
customers are included in the top 25 of each type of contract.  Melissa 
Graves or George Weissman might be able to help with the ""Top 10 Customers"".




Since I couldn't find ""paper"" for some of the original 25 purchase, sales & 
transportation contracts, I continued down the list until I actually had 
""paper"" for 25 of each.
Below is the listing of those additional contracts.

copy of the signatory authority.
 
If you have any questions give me buzz.

Justin, I have no knowledge of any bad faith actins Enron has pending inTexas 
but I will call Richard Sanders who manages domestic litgation here.  I've 
read the materials you sent and agree we need to address these allegations 
appropriately.  

Richard do you have any bad faith litigation pending against any insurers in 
Texas or are you aware of any Enron has filed??  We sued Houston Casualty 
last year but I don't recall making any bad faith claims.  It settled anyway, 
a long time ago.

Michelle,
Did you get my fax on Friday? I guess the questions on which I should like
your steer are: (a) Do you have a particular sensitivity about the reference
to bad faith proceedings made by United India? (b) Is it right that Enron
has 3 sets of bad faith proceedings in Texas? (c) Are you happy with the
draft letter to Beachcrofts I sent you?

Please give me a call if you would like to discuss.

Michelle and Ken,

were you able to discuss the ""bad faith"" proceedings issue yesterday? If
you
got the chance today, I should be really grateful if one of you could give
me a call to discuss this issue; I think we should set out DPC's position
clearly on this in correspondence without too much delay.

Richard,

We are not going to send this letter until Monday.  We want to send the
formal objections to the subpoena concurrently, and Mike Smith cannot review
the EES objections until Monday.  Mike Day believes that a delay until
Monday is not a problem.  Let me know if you have any concerns.

Bouman took a few snaps Thursday but didn't appear to meet coach Dennis Green's ""full strength"" criteria for starting against Green Bay.   Spergon Wynn is likely to start Sunday, though coaches didn't discuss the issue after Thursday's practice. Bouman didn't participate in the team's morning walk-through, when players work on plays without fully suiting up. And during the portion of the regular practice that reporters were allowed to watch, Wynn took more snaps than Bouman. A trainer said Wynn continued to take more snaps later in the closed portion of practice.  </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4238&key=1152&""><B>Jerome Bettis</B></A>, RB PIT - The Rocks <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/28/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>
Bettis, sidelined by a groin injury, returned to the practice field Thursday for the first time in a month. ""Still questionable,"" coach Bill Cowher said. ""He did more today.

Gramatica strained his right hamstring during a 48-21 victory over the Saints last week.

"The feeling on the street is that Reliant was setup with the $1900 sale.  The 
word is that the bid for $1900 power had been sitting there for months and 
that Reliant had an ""understanding"" with DWR and the ISO that the bid was not 
supposed to be taken except in dire need -- it's for a peaker and the price 
represents the opportunity cost of running it now, and using up its very 
limited emission credits, rather than running it during the real peak times 
this summer. The $1900 represents the estimated cost to Reliant of Reliant 
having to buy power this summer on the market when it otherwise would have 
had its peaker available.  The wors is that the state/ISO took the bid, when 
there was not dire need, just to make Reliant look evil and point to ever 
higher prices -- when? -- yes, the week before the Bush plan was to come out.

Press Release

Reliant Energy Urges Governor Davis to Trade Political Fingerpointing for 
Solutions

HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 17, 2001--Reliant Energy strongly disagrees 
with California Governor Gray Davis' recent characterization of the company 
as being ``obstructionist'' and opposing court orders. 

Reliant Energy believes that these accusations are politically motivated 
attempts to demonize Reliant Energy as an outsider responsible for causing 
the state's energy crisis. The accusations are simply not based on fact. More 
importantly, the governor's attacks have done nothing to increase the state's 
supply of electricity or prevent the blackouts expected this summer. If 
anything, the comments have fostered an atmosphere of distrust and 
uncertainty that have further destabilized the market. 

``Reliant hopes the governor and others will stop these baseless accusations 
and focus on true solutions to California's energy shortage,'' said Joe Bob 
Perkins, president and chief operating officer, Reliant Energy Wholesale 
Group. ``We are now being singled out because we believe in an open market, 
not government control of power generation, and we have offered solutions 
that do not jibe with the governor's political agenda. Contrary to the 
perception Governor Davis is attempting to promote, we have been focused on 
providing solutions that are fair to all parties in California since the 
outset of this crisis. In fact, earlier this week we provided the governor's 
office with an outline of a series of emergency measures that, if pursued 
quickly, could help mitigate the power crisis this summer. We are still 
waiting on a response.'' 

Perkins pointed out many of the steps Reliant Energy has taken to keep the 
lights on in California, disputing the accusation of being 
``obstructionist'': 

Reliant Energy has run its 30-to-50-year-old plants at the highest levels 
since their purchase in 1998. In 2000, Reliant nearly doubled the output from 
these plants to meet the needs of Californians -- running them at levels far 
exceeding the prior owner, Southern California Edison.

Reliant Energy invested $80 million dollars in 2000 alone to upgrade plants 
to make sure the most power possible is available during peak times. In 
addition, the company improved emissions levels to clean up the environment 
and keep costs for emission credits to a minimum.

For the last two years, Reliant has encouraged the Investor Owned Utilities 
and the state to invest in long-term contracts to stabilize rates instead of 
relying on the spot market. In particular, Reliant Energy offered to sell 
power at two cents per kilowatt-hour if the buyer would purchase the natural 
gas required to generate the power, ensuring a transparent cost of power.

Reliant Energy has never shut down generation despite the prevalent concerns 
that continue to exist over credit issues. In contrast, just last week a 
major out-of-state supplier refused to continue to sell to California unless 
payment was forthcoming.

Reliant Energy has created an aggressive curtailment plan to encourage 
businesses to ``sell back'' power voluntarily to add more power to the 
Western power grid. The company has met with many leaders in Western states 
to introduce the program, yet California officials will not even engage in a 
dialogue on the program. 

``We welcome the opportunity to discuss these issues one-on-one with the 
governor,'' Perkins said. ``Unfortunately, he has repeatedly refused this 
request over the past year. Last week's meeting with generators was the first 
time the group was allowed to speak with him directly, and obviously the 
purpose of that meeting was political grandstanding.'' 

Perkins added that the governor's accusations of opposing court orders are 
unfounded. ``We have always worked within the law and are proud of our 
commitment to keeping the lights on. We have followed all court orders and 
worked closely with the FERC and others to cooperate fully with all 
investigations. When necessary, we have filed court challenges to orders that 
we believe violate our rights -- hardly an illegal action.''

        I'm checking into a  PG&E citygate basis differential for the 4-months Dec.thru March off the  NYMEX for United Cogen in San Franscisco.  Right now, the 4-month  strip is about $3.03/dth. Whoops, make that $3.26/dth.
 
    Also, I'm checking  into a price for a 38 months firm gas supply at the Citygate to run from  6/1/03-7/31/06.  The volume would be in the 5,000-5,500 dth/day  range.  Everything at United was put on hold following the 9/11  disaster.  If you have any  questions, give me a call.  Is now a good time to buy Enron stock?   Hope you're all doing well.

know what the customer is talking about.  Let us know when ytou find out.

Sue, Mona,

1.  Tomorrow Martin Wenzel is speaking at a 1200 BOMA Luncheon at the 
Sheraton Palace Hotel at the Corner of Market and New Montgomery in San 
Francisco.  Martin was hoping that one of you might be available to attend.  
He thought that if you were not busy it might be valuable to have a 
government affairs expert available in case any tough regulatory questions 
came up.  If you are both busy I am sure we will get by.  We are currently 
trying to structure a new offering for their membership in the greater East 
Bay Area.



2.  Below is an excerpt from an e-mail I received from a customer.  My first 
inclination is that the customer is talking about the $65.00 rate cap in 
place in SDG&E and does not understand the implementation.  But this customer 
happens to be very savvy and is normally very involved in the regulatory 
environment.  Is there a new issue regarding some type of $65.00 rate cap 
that is being discussed for 2001 that is different from the current SDG&E 
proposal?  If so, what are the details.  As you can see below, depending on 
how it is implemented, it could be a problem.  My interpretation of the 
comments below is that this customer thinks a $65.00 rate cap is going to be 
put in place in 2001 and any charges above this cap are going to be shared by 
all rate payers equally. Therefore, it does them no good to lock in a higher 
price with an ESP if the market price is above $65.00.  I have a phone call 
in to the customer to get more details.


""We should talk about prices for next year, because it is my belief that UDC
prices must be below $65.00 next year; any price above that mark should be
ignored by customers, and I would be happy to explain why.""

"Well March probably isn't great for me anyway...going to NYC 8-11, and my 
brother's coming for a week.  So, I guess just keep me posted.  I took a week 
off and went to South Padre island so it took the edge off my need to get 
away, but certainly did not completely satsify.  Still looking for more.

Talk to you later.

Dude

sorry for the long response period - howz it???

So the saga continues - we have no contract extension - in fact - today in
March 1 and our contract ended yesterday - it is anticipated that we will
get an extension through March - but it hasn't happened yet - aye bendito!!!

In a way I hope the whole thing just blows up so I can go hang in the
Caymans for a while - how sweet would that be???

anyway, March is not looking that good - going to CA on the 17,18 - got a
chickie visiting 24/25 - and going to NY for the Pirnie technical symposium
on the 3/31 and 4/1...  how did life get so freekin' hectic.

I'll keep you posted

Steve,

Yo, what's up?  I'm just sitting at work getting the weather updates from

Anyway, I was just wondering what the latest is on the the Pirnie/AFI saga.
Are you out of a job yet?  I'm feeling the need to get the hell out of here
and take a vacation.  Still thinking of your neck of the woods.  Got to

"Hi Jason,
 Grandma and Jill got the packages on Mon.
Also, yesterday you received a check from the IRS. It looks like a separate
letter came too. Do you want me to deposit the check in your checking
account? Do you want me to send the letter or open it to see if it's
important?
 I had to take Grandma to the eye doctor today. (The specialist) It must've
been senior citizen appointment day. It was the routine exam she has once a
year where they dilate her pupils and examine the eyes. Normally, we've been
out of there in 20 to 30 minutes. Today it was 2 and a half hours.
 It is dangerously hot again today.
,Hope it cools down before Dad sprays the trees and shrubs. This area has
had a major infestation of Japenese beetles.
 Better go for now. I  took the mail in and I see that Dad's card is here.
 Love, Mom"

Cemex has previously signed a confidentiality agreement with us based on our

would prefer that we send our form and let them know that it is substantially

"Effective immediately, Ray Bowen will take over leadership of the Industrial 
Origination Group responsible for Enron North America,s origination 
activities in the industrial market including pulp & paper, metals, refining, 
and petrochemicals.  As part of the Industrial Origination Group, Jim Ajello, 
will continue to lead the origination effort in the metals, refining, and 
petrochemical sector.  Edward Ondarza maintains oversight of origination in 
the pulp and paper sectors.  Rodney Malcolm retains primary responsibility 
for leading the execution of transactions and delivery of the outsource 
solutions to industrial customers.

When the Commercial Transactions Group was created approximately a year ago, 
the objective was to create an internal emphasis on the development of 
transaction execution skills that are necessary to execute complex, 
structured transactions and to foster better deal quality.  We believe that 
the primary objectives of the CTG have been achieved, and in order to better 
position the organization for the remainder of 2000 and in response to Ray 
Bowen,s new position, the following changes will be made in the Commercial 
Transactions Group organization.

Transaction Development:  Transaction Development, which was created to 
provide focused deal execution capability to the Origination groups, will be 
merged into each respective origination group and report solely to the group 
leaders. 

Portfolio Management:  All activities surrounding portfolio investments will 
report to Jeff Donahue.  Jeff will be responsible for ENA,s &capital book8 
and will have a high level of involvement in existing portfolio investments 
and will work closely with ENA Treasury and the various origination groups to 
assure that new transactions (a) incorporate appropriate risk/return 
characteristics, (b) are evaluated in the context of market based pricing 
signals, and (c) incorporate a specific investment plan which includes 
syndication of the investment, if applicable, and a specific exit strategy.  
Portfolio Management includes Restructuring/Special Assets (Randy 
Maffett/Dick Lydecker) and Capital Structuring (Andrea Reed).  Steve Pruett 
(Energy Capital Resources), Chuck Ward (Generation Investments), Don Miller 
(Merchant Generation), and Chris Helfrich (Coal and Industrial) will continue 
to be responsible for day to day asset management for performing investments 
and will report to their respective origination units with a dual report to 
Jeff.  Jeff will retain his Corporate Development and Principal Investments 
activities.

Commodity Structuring:  Commodity Structuring including Berney Aucoin (Power) 
and Ed McMichael (Gas) will report to Janet Dietrich.  Janet will retain 
responsibility for East Midstream Origination.  Commodity Structuring will 
continue to work to facilitate and structure the highest priority and highest 
value transactions across the entire ENA organization.

Technical/OEC:  The Technical Group (Wayne Mays/Bob Virgo), which provides 
technical support to industrial and power generation asset development 
activities, and OEC (lead by Mark Dobler) will report directly to the ENA 
Office of the Chairman.


In addition to these changes, Joe Deffner has been named ENA,s Chief 
Financial Officer and will head ENA Treasury.  In this role he will be 
responsible for managing ENA,s balance sheet and the sourcing of capital in 
the bank and capital markets.  Joe will report jointly to the ENA Office of 
the Chairman and to Enron Corp. Global Finance."
"Carol -

Pursuant to our discussion, attached is an updated draft of the BETA with 
Enron.  I have marked all of the changes we have discussed, including those 
discussed earlier today, and provided these edits on the final base BETA 
being used for the website.

As I indicated, the final BETA has been modified from the one originally 
forwarded to you and Natsource for review.  Though we briefly reviewed the 
global changes, I have provided below a copy of the marked version of the 
final, website version.  This is marked against only changes made to the 
original Enron version and does not incorporate any Natsource related 
changes.  As you will recall, any changes that will ultimately be made to the 
BETA will be reflected in a side letter and Natsource will still be required 
to ""accept"" the form BETA on the Website.

Please take a look at the attached when you have a chance and let me know if 
anything further needs to be accomplished.

Thanks.

I called Roger this morning to make sure he had received the BA.  He said
that he had not yet gotten it, but that it should be there around noon.  I
asked him to be sure to get back to me ASAP with any inadequacies, so we
could fix them immediately.  He said that they have decided that they don't
need to have all of the ESA requirements satisfied prior to Public Noticing
the project.  This is good news.  He didn't say how soon they would be able

"Hi John,

The enovate version looks fine.  I suggest this change to the Peoples version:

iv) is required to be disclosed to comply with any applicable law, order, 
regulation or ruling or to enforce enovate,s or PMW,s rights in court or in 
an arbitration proceeding in connection with the Limited Liability Company 
Agreement of envoate dated April 26, 2000, as amended, modified, and 
supplemented from time to time (the &LLC Agreement8). If PEC is requested or 
required (by oral question, interrogatories, requests for information or 
documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to 
disclose any Confidential Information, PEC will promptly notify ENA of such 
request or requirement so that ENA may seek an appropriate protective order 
or waiver in compliance with provisions of this Agreement.  If PEC and ENA 
are both parties to the proceeding, PEC will agree to an appropriate 
protective order.

Subject:	RE: NICOR

Right now the parking and loaned deals that we did or do with NIPSCO are not being booked correctly in Unify.  The volumes are coming over onto Supply Verifications or Sales Invoices depending what we are doing.  These deals should be coming over to the service side so that I can be paying for these deals.  However, I do not have anything on the service side.  Therefore, I have a had to pay (paper) manuals to pay NIPSCO and Darla has outstanding A/R & A/P items since we do not invoice or pay NIPSCO for these deals.  I have requested that Marlene forward the service contracts that are currently in the system to verify what we have setup so that you can make sure the deals are setup and we can get these corrected in Unify.  I need to get my payables issues cleared up as well for the manuals I had to do to get them paid as interest was also charged.  If you need to meet up with Darla and I to show you what we have, please let us know.  The sooner we can get these resolved the better.

Brenna,
         This probably isn't the best time to be mentioning this, and I don't 
want you to think there is any motive behind it because reviews are currently 
in process, but I wanted to briefly talk to you about Judy Hernandez:

I think she puts in a great work performance for many reasons:

1) She is ALWAYS willing to help out when someone is backed up on projects.
2) If you ask her to help you out with something, it's completed within the 
same day or early the next day.
3) She is NEVER in a bad mood, and if she is she certainly doesn't let you 
know about it nor take out her frustrations on anyone.
4) She is very knowledgeable when it comes to questions about deals being 
acceptable or not.
5) If she can't answer your question she points you in the right direction 
for it to be answered. 

I just wanted to let you know how much I appreciate working with her.  
Thanks-Eve

"Good morning
Ok, a few items today.  Sorry to those that showed up Saturday for practice 
and I wasnt there.  At 12:30 it was absolutely dumping rain at my house and I 
just assumed that the field was unplayable and that no one else would want to 
be out there anyways.  So to those brave souls that showed up, I give you my 
appreciation for your effort and again I apologize for either not calling or 
showing up myself.  Along those lines, tomorrows game has a chance of being 
rained out.  The rainout hotline number to call is 503-823-2233, it is 
updated after 3 PM.  Lastly, I have also made some aerial maps of the parks 
that we play at this spring.  I guess you could say that I have too much time 
on my hands, but I have access to some cool programs here at work.  So 
hopefully these will help you guys find the parks.  See you guys tomorrow, 
weather permitting.  Questions, comments, let me know.

"This memo documents the timing of when we set aside reserves for the Colorado 
Springs Utility deal.  It also documents the history of money flowing into 
and out of Matt Motley's P&L.  This is simply an fyi -- there is no action 
needed from you.

The net effect is that we have a $10 million reserve set up for CSU.  With 
respect to trader performance, $5.2 of that came from when Kevin McGowan 
managed the book (his entire ytd earnings before he moved to coal) and $4.8 
came from Motley's P&L.  I thought it would be useful to record it in a 
quasi-official manner to give Motley comfort that he won't get dinged for an 
old shitty deal that happened before he arrived.

Energy Cost Study Critical of Public Agencies Too 
 Power: DWP is among three government-run producers cited as driving prices 
up. Spokesmen deny any market manipulation. 

By ROBERT J. LOPEZ, RICH CONNELL, Times Staff Writers

????Government-owned utilities, including the Los Angeles Department of Water 
and Power, were influential in driving wholesale electricity prices to levels 
that helped ignite California's exploding energy crisis during the summer and 
fall, according to public and confidential records. 
?????For months, Gov. Gray Davis, legislators and consumer advocates have 
chiefly blamed a few private power companies for throwing the state into 
darkness and economic chaos. 
?????But they are just part of the equation. 
?????A confidential document obtained by The Times names power providers that 
have allegedly manipulated the electricity market. While the document does 
identify out-of-state merchants criticized for gouging, it also discloses for 
the first time the extent to which public entities allegedly have maximized 
profits in the volatile spot market. 
?????The document--which decodes the identities of unnamed suppliers in a 
recent state study--singles out three government-run agencies as consistently 
trying to inflate prices. They are: the DWP, the federally owned Bonneville 
Power Administration in the Pacific Northwest and the trading arm of Canada's 
BC Hydro in British Columbia. 
?????Like a number of privately owned generators, these three producers 
offered power at a range of high prices and, sometimes, in large amounts when 
the state was most desperate. They also helped saddle California's three 
largest utilities with billions of dollars in debt--leading one, Pacific Gas 
& Electric, to seek bankruptcy protection last week. 
?????The study by the California Independent System Operator, or Cal-ISO, 
analyzed thousands of hours of bidding practices for 20 large suppliers in 
the spot, or ""real-time,"" market from May to November. The study accounted 
for factors such as rising production costs, increased demand, periods of 
scarcity and profits that would be earned in a healthy, competitive market. 
?????Money earned above that was called excess profits. 
?????No entity--public or private--earned as much in alleged excess profits 
as British Columbia's Powerex, the state records show. 
?????""They were the most aggressive bidders,"" said Anjali Sheffrin, author of 
the coded study. 
?????""They had the most amount to bid and the most freedom to bid it in,"" 
said Sheffrin, who did not discuss any companies by name. 
?????The Canadian agency reaped $176 million in alleged excessive 
profits--several times the amount collected by all but one of the private 
generators. Second on the list was Atlanta-based Southern Co. Energy 
Marketing, now called Mirant, which collected nearly $97 million in alleged 
inflated earnings. 
?????BC Hydro and Mirant--along with the DWP and other producers--say they 
played by the rules established under California's flawed deregulation plan 
and did not exploit the state's troubles. 
?????But BC Hydro officials acknowledge that they did anticipate periods of 
severe power shortages and planned for them by letting their reservoirs rise 
overnight and then opening them to create hydroelectricity, which could be 
produced inexpensively but sold for a premium. 
?????""It was the marketplace that determined what the price of electricity 
would be at any given time,"" said BC Hydro spokesman Wayne Cousins. ""We 
helped keep the lights on in California."" 
?????And the rates low for their own customers. During the past year, BC 
Hydro has stashed hundreds of millions dollars in a ""rainy day"" account to 
ensure that it has among the lowest rates in North America. 
?????Los Angeles' Department of Water and Power, although eighth on the list 
of alleged profiteers, was among those singled out for seeking high prices 
during periods of high demand that helped inflate costs across the entire 
spot market, where emergency purchases are made. 
?????This, according to state documents, was accomplished by offering power 
at incrementally higher prices that would rise substantially with even modest 
increases in demand. The strategy also helped prop up prices, keeping them 
from falling. 
?????The DWP's average hourly bid, or asking price, for electricity 
ultimately bought topped such private sellers as Reliant Energy of Houston 
and Tulsa-based Williams Cos., two major players in the national energy 
market. 
?????In addition, the DWP submitted other bids at far higher prices that 
could pay off handsomely with even small bumps in demand, the report said, 
referring by code to DWP and four other suppliers. ""The data shows they 
clearly exercised market power to inflate prices further at higher load 
conditions."" 
?????DWP General Manager S. David Freeman called the report's findings 
""outrageous,"" insisting that the utility never tried to inflate prices. 
?????""These charges go under the heading there is no good deed that goes 
unpunished in this state,"" Freeman said, noting that DWP power helped avert 
more blackouts across the state. 
?????He did acknowledge, however, that the agency has charged high prices for 
surplus power at the 11th hour but said that was only because it cost more to 
produce. 
?????""We have consistently charged [Cal-ISO] our cost, plus 15%,"" he said. 
""It's not as though we're up there peddling a bunch of power to jam it down 
their throats."" 
?????Freeman said that when his staff reviewed the coded report, they never 
took it personally. ""If you're innocent,"" he said, ""you don't look at the 
criminal file."" 
?????Yet another public agency criticized for its behavior in California's 
deregulated market was the U.S. government's Bonneville Power Administration, 
a nonprofit agency that sells wholesale electricity produced at 29 federal 
dams in the Columbia-Snake River basin. 
?????Bonneville actually bid slightly lower than the DWP, records show, but 
reaped millions more in alleged excessive profits, apparently because it 
supplied greater amounts of power during the period studied. Bonneville was 
in the top five accused of taking excessive profits. 
?????Bonneville officials say some of its profits are used to pay back 
federal construction loans and fund an internationally recognized salmon 
recovery program. 
?????Stephen Oliver, a Bonneville vice president, said his agency did not act 
improperly and has asked Cal-ISO for detailed information on how it reached 
its conclusions. He said the grid operator often came to Bonneville pleading 
for last-minute electricity and offering to pay high prices. 
?????""From our point of view, we bid what we had when we had it and we 
operated precisely within the terms of their rules,"" Oliver said. 
?????Those rules--and the bidding practices criticized by Cal-ISO--so 
distorted the market that Aquila Power Corp. of Missouri, which tried to act 
responsibly, has bailed out. 
?????It offered the lowest average hourly price of any supplier 
studied--slightly more than $8 per megawatt-hour, compared to Mirant's $138, 
the highest. 
?????But the spot market, as initially designed, made sure that all suppliers 
offering power received the highest price paid in any hour. 
?????The result: Aquila collected $171 an hour for power it was willing to 
sell at a single-digit price. 
?????""They weren't the culprits,"" said Cal-ISO's Sheffrin. ""Someone else 
drove that up."" 
?????Aquila spokesman Al Butkus said the company pulled out of the California 
market because it was too unpredictable. Although the company made money, he 
said, it also could have lost because of possible downward swings. 
?????""We looked at it and we didn't feel very comfortable with what we saw,"" 
he said. 
?????The market has since been adjusted to prevent high bids from setting the 
price for everyone. But Sheffrin said it hasn't made much difference because 
the overall prices are still excessive. 
?????""We're saying the patient is sick,"" Sheffrin said of California's 
electricity market. ""It needs help [and] may die.""

They are relying on real-time information, customer knowledge and leveraging
Internet based partnerships to conduct business. The value of success is
established through ""advantaged relationships"" with trading partners,
knowing and fulfilling customer needs, anticipating future requirements, and
knowledge to create new products and services based on customer needs.
Customers require ""Build to Order, Partner to Fit"" based solutions that are
tailored to their requirements. This model relies on real-time knowledge
exchange within the virtual enterprise based on a network of alliances and
partnerships. Cambira solutions enable the creation of the network between
customer, vendor, virtual supply chain partners, and complementary solution
providers that will be known as the Virtual Trading Partner Network (V-TPN).

our mission is and I would certainly appreciate the opportunity to give you
a more detailed presentation. Attached are a few slides to give you a more
visual depiction of our aims.  Again, we appreciate your time and I look
forward to future collaboration with you.

Best regards,

Morning Market View(TM) 
for Thursday, December 27, 2001
as of 9:30AM EST
Information provided by Schwab Center for Investment Research


MARKETS LOOK TO OPEN SLIGHTLY HIGHER

U.S. equity index futures are pointing to a slightly higher open 
as economic and equity news is sparse this morning. Apple 
Computer (AAPL,22,f1) said its retail outlets may report a loss 
in 2002 and TMP Worldwide (TMPW,42,f1) stated it would not boost 
its offer for Hotjobs.com (HOTJ,10.67,f1). U.S. Treasuries are 
flat and world markets are higher.

TMP Worldwide, provider of the popular Monster.com web site, 
reported that it would not increase its bid for competitor 
Hotjobs.com, saying it had offered ""full and fair value"" for the 
entity. Hotjobs announced on Monday that it would accept a $436 
million offer from rival bidder Yahoo! (YHOO,17.51,f1) if TMP 
did not increase its proposal, which has shrunk since June given 
declines in TMP's stock. If the acquisition fails, TMP is 
entitled to as much as $17 million in termination and 
reimbursement fees from Hotjobs and the company would remain the 
No. 1 online recruitment site.

Apple Computer said it now expects its retail stores to incur a 
loss in 2002, contrary to forecasts made last May predicting 
retail profitability for the year ending in fiscal 2002. Apple 
blamed the setback on the economic recession in the U.S. and the 
slowdown in the PC market, exacerbated by the terrorist attacks. 
The California-based computer maker opened 27 retail stores this 
year, two more than originally planned.

----------------------------------------------------------------

TREASURY AND ECONOMIC SUMMARY 

U.S. Treasury prices are little changed across the curve ahead 
of today's record $23 billion 2-year note auction. Friday's 
economic plate is full as initial jobless claims, originally 
scheduled for release this morning, will be released tomorrow. 
In addition, consumer confidence figures, the Chicago Purchasing 
Managers' Index, new and existing home sales, and durable goods 
orders will be reported.

----------------------------------------------------------------

WORLD MARKETS 

European markets are marginally higher with the Bloomberg 
European 500 index up 0.8% as of 8:53 a.m. EST, led by bank, 
telecom and energy shares. In economic news, French business 
confidence rose to 90.0 in December, higher than the 89.5 
estimate per Bloomberg and November's 89.0 reading. On the 
corporate front, Nestle SA (NSRGY,52,f1) paid $641 million to 
General Mills (GIS,52,f2) in a joint venture giving it the 
rights to Haagen-Dazs in the U.S. and Canada. Oil-related issues 
also did well as companies like Royal Dutch Petroleum NV 
(RD,49,f2) rose on expectations that OPEC will announce its 1.5 
million barrel per day production cut on Friday. The euro is 
trading higher versus the U.S. dollar.

Asian markets finished higher as the Nikkei 225 index advanced 
2.6% with technology and export issues leading the way. In 
economic news, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry 
reported that Japanese industrial production declined a 
seasonally adjusted 1.8% in November to the lowest level in 14 
years. Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi reiterated plans to cut 
spending and force banks to write of bad debt, saying, ""... we 
must press on with employment measures and structural reforms."" 
Following the positive retail news in the U.S. yesterday, 
exporters fared well with companies like Sony Corp. (SNE,44) 
advancing. The yen fell versus the U.S. dollar given the weak 
economic data.

----------------------------------------------------------------

FUTURES WATCH 

In the March Globex futures contract as of 8:51 a.m. EST, the 
S&P 500 index was up a point (3 points above fair value) while 
the Nasdaq 100 index was 1 point higher (5 points above fair 
value). The March DJIA futures contract was down 7 points (25 
points above fair value), and the February crude oil futures 
traded on the NYMEX were down $0.68 at $20.59/barrel.

ISO New England and PJM Interconnection Propose a
Standard Market Design for Wholesale Electricity Markets

March 29, 2001 - HOLYOKE, MA -  Two of the country's leading wholesale
electricity market administrators, ISO New England Inc. and PJM 
Interconnection,
L.L.C., together with ALSTOM ESCA Corporation, a systems developer for 
electric
utilities, today announce their intent to formalize an agreement that will not
only standardize their electricity markets, but will lead, they believe, to 
the
standardization of wholesale electricity markets across the country.

Today, ISO New England delivered a letter to the Chairman and Commissioners of
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), enclosing a report concerning
its proposed comprehensive wholesale market program that combines salient
features of the PJM market model with elements of its own existing wholesale
market design.  The combination would create a standardized wholesale market
structure called the Standard Market Design for wholesale electricity markets
(""Standard Market Design"").

ISO New England, ALSTOM ESCA and PJM, acting through its wholly-owned
subsidiary, PJM Technologies Inc., have agreed to proceed with the negotiation
of an agreement where ISO New England will purchase the existing PJM market
design and certain software components from ALSTOM ESCA and PJM.  The two ISOs
and ALSTOM ESCA will work together to create a standardized market design that
includes solutions to reserve markets and a common solution to unit dispatch.

""This new market standard should put into place the necessary market
improvements more quickly and at a reduced cost than if we were to implement a
customized market system for New England,"" said William W. Berry, Chairman and
Acting CEO of ISO New England.  ""Now is the time to stop the experimentation.
Ultimately, we hope the Standard Market Design will serve as the benchmark for
wholesale electricity marketplaces across the country, if not around the 
world.""


""PJM is very excited to further standardize a design for a competitive 
wholesale
electricity market,"" said Phillip G. Harris, Chairman and CEO of PJM. ""Along
with the progress in the implementation of the PJM West concept, this 
initiative
will provide an even broader standardized market design.""

This approach should further expedite the elimination of trading barriers 
across
different markets and promote FERC's goal of creating a seamless marketplace.
""We intend to continue to work with the New York ISO on issues of mutual
importance,"" stated Mr. Berry.  ""This new market design, together with our
efforts to address the market ""seams"" and other coordination issues, will
eventually bring the three northeast ISO markets closer together.""  ISO New
England and the New York ISO will continue to work together on these issues
under a joint board resolution passed on January 16, 2001.

""Because of our geographic location, New York is in the center of the 
Northeast
markets, with ISO New England, PJM and IMO each on one of our borders.  We
support the continued elimination of barriers across Northeast trading markets
to develop a more seamless marketplace where everyone will benefit,"" said
William J. Museler, President and CEO of the New York Independent System
Operator. ""The New York ISO will continue to work with our neighboring markets
to remove barriers to trading across the region and to move towards larger
regional markets.""

This proposed market design standard will be developed jointly with 
stakeholder
input. ISO New England will propose the Standard Market Design to the New
England Conference of Public Utility Commissioners and the New England Power
Pool in a series of meetings next week.  Additional meetings will be conducted
in the next few weeks. The Standard Market Design for New England will be
subject to FERC approval.

""Standardization requires consistent and reliable technology to facilitate a
market's efficiency.  A market that moderates price fluctuations and 
encourages
investment based on an expected return is an efficient market -- and 
efficiency
is the key to establishing market liquidity,"" said Alain Steven, CEO of ALSTOM
ESCA.  ""In the future, this agreement will be viewed as a catalyst in
establishing more robust electricity markets.""

ISO New England Inc. is the not-for-profit corporation responsible for the
day-to-day reliable operation of New England's bulk generation and 
transmission
systems with an installed capacity of almost 26,000 megawatts.  In addition to
operating the bulk power grid, ISO New England is the administrator of the
region's wholesale electricity marketplace and the Open Access Transmission
Tariff on behalf of the New England Power Pool. ISO New England is based in
Holyoke, Massachusetts.

The PJM Interconnection, L.L.C., is an Independent System Operator,
administering the PJM Open Access Transmission Tariff and operating the PJM
Energy Markets and Capacity Markets. PJM currently administers the largest
wholesale electricity market in the world and has a membership of more than 
200.
It is headquartered in Norristown, Pennsylvania. PJM Technologies, Inc. is a
wholly-owned subsidiary of PJM Interconnection, L.L.C., designed to respond to
market opportunities by bringing cost-effective, reliable solutions to the
energy marketplace. It was created to commercialize PJM's knowledge capital,
experience, and proven success in electric energy markets, system operations,
and applications development.

"Mara, 

Attached is the spreadsheet for billing Palo Alto.  I think that everything we need for billing purposes is there, we just need to improve it and make it user friendly.  We will provide this spreadsheet to accounting by the 10th of each month for the previous flow month. therefore, once we get August done, we will need to work on September.  Once you've had a chance to look at it, we can discuss.  Also, I have a notebook at my desk that details everything about Palo Alto.  

Thanks,

Kim

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

Larry Althouse"
"To contribute our personal best at ENRON, our conduct must promote respectful

Subject:	Re: Approval procedure for Pending Products   

 We are introducing functionality which will allow token reference periods for balance of month products, the scheduled process will therefore re-create these products every day automatically (essentially just a change to the description).  Therefore the product will already be there.   In the mean time, all of the other desks have been creating their products ahead of time to deal with this issue - we currently have most desks creating products weeks/months in advance.  This software change is scheduled for Friday to prevent traders from going through this issue next month (February).

We have only 2 logged/taped phone calls to the HelpDesk when Portland office has called the HelpDesk  with regard to this issue. Clearly in the second case we see a 9 minute gap, but this appears to be a single incident and not really something of the level of significance specified in your memo.  Dale does come in early specifically for any products Portland did not create the day before but obviously there can be times (bad traffic) when he may be late.

14/1 	07:35 (CST) J Richter  called to approve products
	Products activated products within 2 minutes.

24/1 	07:34 (CST) J Richter called  to approve products
	07:45 (CST) Anna Gardiner approved products
	07:46 (CST) J Richter called to inquire on status
	07:48 (CST) HelpDesk rang J Richter back to check that he had seen approval and had no technical problems
	
Clearly we are not intentionally trying to create a problem but EnronOnline is a new product and everyone is putting an immense amount of effort into getting the product up and running and helping everyone.  We only seem to have 2 times that  the procedure has been used to the HelpDesk extent and not failed dramatically.

Changing the procedure for two days (assuming succesful implementation of the tokenized reference periods) when we are all working  to keep the system up and running and keep all customers informed of developments may create more problems.  If we do not introduce this software change on Friday we should review this policy - I obviously have no problem with Tim approving such products as we will be moving to that level of authority shortly anyway.

Subject:	Approval procedure for Pending Products

I would like to talk  with you concerning our current procedure for daily approval of newly created products.  IT IS NOT WORKING!  The current procedure is for us to create the product and call Dale Neuner and let him know its out there.  If Dale is not in the office, or it is before or after normal work hours, the traders need to call the help desk, who in turn calls Amita in the London office who then approves the product.   The Portland office starts trading at 5:00 AM PPT.  In the event a product is not created ahead of time they create the product in the morning.  This morning the traders had several daily products pending approval.  It took 45 minutes to get those products approved.  On daily products the trading period may last only 1 hour.  As a result, the trader missed most of the trading period.  OUR CUSTOMERS ARE NOT HAPPY AND NEITHER ARE THE TRADERS.  

A solution was proposed in December, which I have attached below, to address this issue.  However, it only works in the ideal world.  It would be overly optimistic to think that we are going to be able to always be able to create our products ahead of time.  That is not the reality.  By rolling out our products we have created an implicate contract with our customers that we will consistently make markets in the products we trade.

I would like to propose an alternate solution.  We need a direct method for Tim Belden to have approval rights to approve existing products.  These are not new products, we trade them every day.  There is no reason Tim should not have a level of approval to, at the very least approve existing products.  Especially where the only change is the term.

Please call Tim Belden at 503-464-3820 or myself at 503-464-3836.  Look forward to hearing from you.

Enron's Portland Office is a few hours ahead of Houston.  There are times where Portland needs products approved and the Houston Product Control Group is not available.  As it is important that products get approved as soon as possible, a new process has been put in place .   

1.	PORTLAND Trader calls for Product Approval.
2.	Advise Dale Neuner asap (x3-9746).
3.	If Dale is not physically able to take call, please call Amita Gosalia (x830-3-6888).
4.	Should Amita not be available, please advise PCG member that Portland
	need a product(s) approved.
5.	PCG member will find Amita, and get product approved asap.

Note:  Please be sure to assign the Remedy ticket to the appropriate group.

If you have any questions regarding this new procedure, please advise!

Thanks,

Subject:	Product Activation for Portland Power

Mike -

Regarding our conversation re: support of Power trading, we propose the following:

1) Suggest to trading that they create all DRAFT products that they will need for the next business day at the end of their day. I will always check for DRAFT products at the end of my day and Activate any that are in DRAFT. Just  FYI, Gas trading has adopted the practice of creating their products a couple of days (or weeks) in advance. I keep track of those and keep their products current in advance. It works very well.

2) I am usually at my desk no later than 7:30 a.m. each day. If trading creates a DRAFT product that they need activated prior to that time they should contact the Call Center at 3-4357 and state the following:

THIS IS PORTLAND POWER TRADING AND I NEED A PRODUCT ACTIVATED ASAP. PLEASE CONTACT AMITA GOSALIA IN LONDON.

The Call Center will then contact Amita, who has the authority and responsibility for activating products. Amita has agreed to perform this function for Portland Power and will instruct her people at PCG-London to locate her immediately (in the event that she is away from her desk) when this message comes in from the Call Center.

Donna Greif in the Call Center has been appraised of this procedure and will roll it out to the responsible Call Center personnel.

I hope this solves the problem. Please feel free to offer any comments or call if any part of this process is unclear.

Dale

Kevin, I got your message about not being available for dinner -  no
problem.  The other panelists were arriving too late also, so the dinner
was cancelled.

I just wanted to touch base and make sure you had everything thing you need

it's about 10 minutes outside of downtown.  I would be happy to make
arrangements for a sedan to pick you up if you like; just let me know from

The event begins with a buffet breakfast at 7:30 a.m. and your panel will
begin at 8:45 a.m.  Jeff would like to meet with you, David Arnoff  and
John Thornton around 8:15 a.m. to cover any last minute items about the
panel.
I'll be at the North Shepherd facility beginning about 2:00 p.m. CDT today,
so you can reach me on my cell phone (713.854.1426).  Do not hesitate to
call me should you have any questions or need additional information as I
will not have access to e-mail after 2:00 p.m.

I agree with you. Two trips are the best solution, unless of course Shmuel

the speaker list and the 16th will work for the presentation as well.

Actually, the General Presentation that I have scheduled for the Faculty Club

the 16th.    I can attempt to change the presentation date again, however I 
feel that it would be very unlikely that we are able to get another facility 
that is near campus.  At this point it may be better to plan on making two 
seperate trips so that we are able to handle both events.  Maybe we could 
combine another presentation in during the same visit.  What do you think?

"dreary (DRIR-ee) adjective

   1. Dismal; bleak.

   2. Boring; dull.

[Middle English dreri, bloody, frightened, sad, from Old English dreorig,
bloody, sad, from dreor, gore.]

   ""Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high
   Where knowledge is free
   Where the world has not been broken up into fragments
   By narrow domestic walls
   Where words come out from the depth of truth
   Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection
   Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way
   Into the dreary desert sand of dead habit
   Where the mind is led forward by thee
   Into ever-widening thought and action
   Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.""
   Rabindranath Tagore, Gitanjali.

This week's theme: words from poetry.

Weather Headlines
Tuesday January 29, 2002
A very healthy spring/winter storm to deal with in the short term. This
storm will bring about a pattern change, though still nothing severe in
terms of cold.
A mixed bag of precipitation has developed today over the Central Plains. A
healthy combination of shallow cold air in the North and record warmth in
the South will help spin up a sizeable storm in the Southern Plains later
today that will turn to the NE. There are a variety of winter weather
watches out from Kansas, Missouri , Nebraska, Iowa, and Illinois. More can
be expected through the Great Lakes and New England later in the week.
There will be snow with this, but also some potential for significant
freezing rain as well. The storm track is expected to run from NW Texas to
just South of Chicago then Western New York. To the South, this is a rain
event with some thunderstorms as well. This storm will serve to collapse
the strong ridge that has been in place over the Eastern U.S. I certainly
expect a drop from the record highs of recent days, but nothing in the
earth shattering cold category. In fact, the raw numbers from the MRF have
trended warmer the last few runs. Since we don't have a thick snow cover to
tap from, I believe the period of cold setting up will not be as harsh as
what we saw in late December. As all of this is going on, some of the chill
that has invaded the West will be lifting out. I don't see a big run to
above normal with a surface high still sitting over the plateau region, but
it should not be as cold as the last couple of days.
While the talk in recent outlooks for the 6-10 day period has centered on
cold, it is interesting to note the new 6-10 and 8-14 day outlooks from the
NWS still have a warm bias to them. There is not a big snow cover on the
ground, a split flow in the jet stream is expected and the polar vortex in
Canada continues a slow retreat. With all of that as a backdrop, the slight
positive departures look reasonable to me. We may however crank out a
""Clipper Type"" storm next week in the Great Lakes and New England. These
can sometimes be more prodigious snow makers than the big ""Plains type""
counterpart we are currently seeing. This is especially true if the air
flows over the Lakes at the right angle, something I won't even try to
predict this far out. Other than this system, I don't see much action in
the 6-10 day period. However, there is some potential for another storm to
emerge out of the SW just after this.
For the period Tuesday January 29 through Saturday February 2, expect the
following temperature trends:
Average 4 to 6-degrees below normal: Intermountain West, Desert SW,
California, Pacific NW...
Average 1 to 3- degrees below normal: Plains and Rockies...
Average 4 to 9-degrees above normal: Great Lakes, Mississippi Valley...
Average 10 to 15-degrees above normal: Ohio Valley, Mid-Atlantic,
Northeast, Gulf Coast, Southeast...

Jason/Tom

The Mack-Cali deal is getting hot and they hope to sign an Master and CA confirm on this Thursday.

The client has a major issue with the excess and deficiency only cutting in Enron's favor.

The desk does not have an issue with letting it cut both ways.  I'm am currently investigating this with the consumption group.

Does your group have any issues with allowing it to cut both ways?   I know there is a settlement issue, but we've done it in the Boston Properties and other deals, so I'm assuming that the systems are build (or being built).

Given the tight time frame on this deal, a quick response would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

B

Dear Mark,

Just wanted to let you know that I sent one of our young Japanese analysts 
along to an ISDA committee meeting earlier this week. His name is Takuro 
Shioda and he has been working on the commercial side with Bank of Tokyo 
Mitsubishi, with whom we are currently negotiating an ISDA master.

The ISDA people here are trying generally to get more non-legal 
non-documentary  trading types involved in the Japanese language committees 
because of how valuable this sort of feedback is in terms of practical 
application of the ISDA docs and they have indicated that they would be 
particularly  grateful for help from Enron in this regard.

None of our Japanese traders have any real ISDA experience but I have taken 
this as a first step.  We cant do much more for ISDA on this front at this 
point in time but obviously as we put ISDA masters in place and trade under 
them this situation will change.

Jane

Subject: Reg. Information - Interconnecting Generation in the East

This is a brief primer to assist you with current policy regarding 
interconnecting generation plants in the East.  Please forward this to your 
groups.  Thanks.  Christi Nicolay 37007  EB3108h.  I am available for your 
federal/FERC regulatory questions and can point you to the correct 
state/regional regulatory people.

When initially deciding where to site a plant, there are several federal 
regulatory issues to consider:  

First, you will need to obtain the utility's interconnection policy and a pro 
forma interconnection agreement from the utility.  For most utilities, you 
will need to call them to obtain their policy and agreement.  Some utilities 
have this available on their OASIS computer site or web page.  The OASIS 
sites have areas that do not require a password, but if the information is 
not available in that area, you should contact the power trading desk 
transmission personnel to assist in locating the information.  If a utility 
says it does not have a policy, you can let me know.

The interconnection procedures typically require you to send in a request for 
the utility to study the interconnection (Typically, app. $10,000).  When you 
return the money and the request (which is usually an agreement that must be 
initialled by ENA legal), the project will be placed in the ""queue.""  The 
queue is usually available on the OASIS.  If the utility does not post the 
queue, let me know.  

Many times the procedures require the project to meet ""milestones"" in order 
to remain in the queue.  If the milestones look unreasonable, let me know.

FERC (the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission) recently issued an order 
(Tennessee Power case) in which FERC stated that asking for ""interconnection"" 
is separate from a request for ""transmission"" under a utility's Open Access 
Transmission Tariff (OATT).  Enron and others had lobbied FERC to issue an 
order dealing with interconnection.  Many utilities will try to charge 
additional ""network upgrade"" costs, not simply the costs to interconnect.  
This is not allowed under the new FERC rule (Note: PJM and NEPOOL have 
different rules due to their pool structure).  

In addition, in the Tennessee Power case, FERC stated that utilities are 
required to abide by certain timelines during the interconnection study 
process.  Generally, these timelines are in the attachment below.  Most of 
the interconnection policies I have seen have timelines significantly longer 
than what FERC is now requiring.  You should probably first call the utility 
to ask if they are planning to revise the deadlines to comply with FERC's new 
order.  If that doesn't work, you can call me.

There are several utilities that have filed their interconnection procedures 
at FERC:  PJM, NEPOOL, Ameren, Entergy, ComEd.  Enron is actively protesting 
Entergy's proposed procedures and interconnection agreement (a FERC order is 
expected 4/26/00).  In addition, ComEd's procedures have been protested and a 
FERC order is expected soon.  Other utilities may be filing their procedures 
shortly.  Once you have gotten the procedures and interconnection agreements, 
I am happy to review them.

An ENA attorney must sign off on the interconnection agreement.  Generally, I 
review the interconnection agreement from a regulatory perspective.  It is 
important to have someone in Genco review it if Enron will own or operate it 
after in-service or if EPMI plans to purchase power from the plant.  The 
interconnection agreement usually contains operational provisions, including 
imbalance provisions, that are typically very one sided toward the utility, 
so it is important to have Enron technical input before the agreement is 
executed.

Asking for interconnection and getting in a queue is not a request for 
transmission.  You should consult the power trading desk transmission people 
in order to determine whether a request for firm or non-firm transmission 
needs to be made.  The desk can make the request if necessary.  While the 
desk may choose to use daily/hourly non-firm transmission for some of the 
Enron plants, the decision is made on a case-by-case basis.  You do not want 
your plant to be ""stranded"" without the ability to wheel electricity away 
from the busbar, unless you are building a plant in order to sell power 
directly to the interconnected utility, and even then, you may want to wheel 
power around at times.

If the utility does not have enough transmission capability to wheel power 
from the plant, the plant/Enron may have to pay ""network upgrades.""  You want 
to make sure that you are reserving transmission on a firm (priority) basis 
if you pay for network upgrades.  Some utilities simply provide ""transmission 
credits"" when requiring network upgrades.  These are not as valuable to Enron 
because there may be no opportunity to ever wheel the power if Enron doesn't 
have a ""reservation"" for the transmission.  The Eastern interconnection is 
prone to curtailments of transmission called ""TLRs,"" especially in the 
summer.  The Power Trading desk can assist in obtaining the transmission.

In order to sell power to the grid, the plant must apply to FERC for ""Exempt 
Wholesale Generator"" (EWG) status and also obtain a FERC Power Marketer 
license with ""Market Based Rates.""  These filings make the on-site generator 
a ""utility"" for FERC purposes and subjects the ""power marketer"" to periodic 
filings at FERC.  These generally must be filed at least 60 days before the 
plant will start producing any power.  The filings take several weeks to 
prepare.

Do not assume that you can sell ancillary services from the plant.  The plant 
may not be able to sell ancillary services into the market.  EPMI has the 
FERC authorization to sell certain ancillary services in California and 
NEPOOL, but EPMI cannot, at this time, sell in other areas (absent a FERC 
filing and setting up an OASIS web page).  Be aware that many utilities add 
language in their interconnection agreements that allow them to ""take"" the 
ancillary services from your plant, without compensation.

If you are dealing with an industrial that has a plant on-site, additional 
issues are involved.  You can check on the Enron home page under ""Sites"", 
""Intranet"", ""Government Affairs"", ""State Restructuring Reports"" for 
information on the status of retail open access in that state.  If you need 
additional assistance, contact Elizabeth Linnell 33896.  

Generally, the state must have retail open access in order for Enron to sell 
power to a plant.  In order for an on-site plant to sell power to the grid,  
it must apply to FERC for ""Exempt Wholesale Generator"" (EWG) status and also 
obtain a FERC Power Marketer license with ""Market Based Rates.""  These 
filings make the on-site generator a ""utility"" for FERC purposes and subject 
the ""power marketer"" to periodic filings at FERC.  Because some industrials 
may not want to be FERC regulated, ENA may be able to use a ""Special Purpose 
Vehicle"" (SPV) so that ENA may own part of the generator.  There are also 
options to establish a ""Qualified Facility"" (QF) that sells power to the 
interconnected utility.  The interconnected utility may also have a program 
in which it purchases excess power from the on-site plant.  Please contact 
Bob Frank 33180 for help on possible regulatory structures.

There may also be issues if the plant is connecting to a lower voltage line, 
such as a 69kv or 138kv.  Some utilties have filed to put these lines into 
their distribution systems, rather than in the wholesale transmission system, 
which may take them out of FERC jurisdiction for wheeling purposes.  We have 
not fully examined this type of situation, but can if necessary.

There are other regulatory issues, such as site permitting, political 
assistance, environmental permits, that must also be addressed.  The regional 
regulatory people in Rick Shapiro's government affairs group can assist you.

To whom it may concern:

I recently returned from a wonderful vacation to Telluride.  It was wonderful 
except for the fact that I traveled on your airline.  

I was originally supposed to leave out of IAH at 6:05 AM on 12/9/00 for 
Phoenix and catch a 10:00 AM connection to Telluride 
(the only flight of the day from Phoenix to Telluride).  Unfortunately, the 
flight was cancelled due to the re-routing of our plane because 
of foggy conditions in the Houston area.  I do not blame America West for 
this; It is understandable to cancel this flight because of 
the danger involved in landing in foggy conditions. There is, however, no 
danger involved in taking off in these conditions, which 
leads me to the point of this complaint.  Your ticketing staff in IAH was 
less than helpful in re-routing us on another airline 
(Continental/United/American had several flights that could have delivered us 
to Phoenix in time to catch our connection) so that 
we could make our connection.  Instead, we were told that it was impossible 
to find a flight that could get us to Phoenix in time for this 
connection.  Subsequently, I called other airlines and confirmed space on 
flights that would have  delivered us to Phoenix on time.  
It now appears that America West was more willing to sacrifice a day of my 
vacation rather than pay up to put me on another flight.  
I am extremely disillusioned with the service we received; Because we missed 
our connection we were forced to spend a combined 
6 hrs in the Phoenix and Houston airports and eventually fly into Montrose, 
CO where we had to drive 100 miles to Telluride.  Instead 
of arriving in Telluride, Co at 12pm on 12/9 we arrived at 10pm, a full ten 
hours later.  This delay caused the waste of one full day of 
vacation.  Myself and members of my group will never fly your airline again 
because of this experience.

"Sounds good to me.

By the way, I was in Houston last week except Friday (had a meeting with FPL in Florida). Sorry I didn't come up to see you to talk more about this, or follow up with Canada. I guess I got my wires crossed because I thought in our meeting and calls the prior week that I was supposed to wait for further instructions before proceeding on transfer discussions with Canada.

In any case, Chris and I spoke today, and we are going to have a conference call with Brett this afternoon. He has already had discussions with Canada on a transfer price, thus establishing the bid - offer spread. Brett, Chris and I have already had various preliminary discussions on the shared turbine book, and how we think we should set it up. The rest of the transaction on the ABBs is understood from Canada's customer list and your e-mail below. 

We'll be able to wrap up a draft Turbine Book strategy as you requested shortly, and propose a transfer price on the ABB units.

Hello, 

As I didn't hear anything last week on whether we had made progress on the transfer/sale of the ABB turbines (I know Ben was out too ) I thought I would put my thoughts in writing.  I am assuming that we are all on board with the fact that transferring these assets to the Turbine Book is the most efficient mechanism for dealing with the turbines going forward - please let me know if anyone thinks otherwise (excluding arguments about transfer pricing).

Transfer ABB turbines to the Turbine Book (under the management of Jacoby and Calger), capital charges to be picked up by the Turbine Book as of 7/01/01.   The Turbine Book is responsible for the turbines going forward.

Should a sale occur (negotiated by ECC) to any of the customers outlined in the documents, ECC has the right to buy back the assets at any time at the transfer price plus capital charge incurred during the period when the turbines were owned by the Turbine Book.  The call option expires 9/01/01 and can only be exercised for a sale to the counterparties in the document attached with the addition of Calpine for the purposes of a sale combined with the site (the call option for a Calpine sale is valid until 12/01/01).  If  ECC does not wish to pursue the sale to the counterparties in the document attached, then Jacoby can pursue these negotiations and if a sale is completed this year with these counterparties, the Turbine Book will receive a brokerage fee ($1 million) and ECC will pick up capital costs between 7/01/01 and the completion of the sale. 

Please agree to a transfer price for these turbines, if a price cannot be agreed between you, please let me have your arguments substantiating your transfer price and I will arbitrate on the number on Friday.  Let me know if anyone disagrees with moving forward in this way.

Regards

Louise

Subject: Appalachian Priorities

Hello!

As you know, Terry Franklin is beginning to transition into the Appalachian 
coordination role.  We spent time today with Bryce Baxter, Wade Price, and 
Gloria Barkowsky to determine how best to attack the current issues.

As Job 1, we determined that Terry's time is best utilized on transportation 
contract set-up.  Of course, Terry ""job description"" includes other tasks, 
but at this time, this is her #1 focus.  We decided this for the following 
reasons:

1.  Deals cannot be pathed without transportation contracts set-up in SITARA.
2.  In order to pay the producers and the pipeline, the deals must be pathed 
by Logistics (zero volume paths), and volumes must by allocated (based on 
actuals) by Gloria Barkowsky, Volume Mgmt.
3.  Wade Price, Settlements, is focused on setting up SITARA deals for 
producer wellhead purchases.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.
Thanks,
Carrie

Garrett,
Recognizing that Ontario does not open until Mar 02, and recognizing that we have positions starting then, and recognizing that the curve doesn't have prices posted for reference dates prior to Mar 02, the value-at-risk engine is getting errors in it's simulations due to lack of prices thereof.  

Can you do either of the below?
?	Post prices for dates up to Mar 02?  (realize their isn't market?.tough issue)
o	If you post a price, I'm not sure it will mean much other than letting VAR run, primarily because there isn't position prior to Mar 02. Perhaps you can fill in hole with a realistic price so prompt month correlations don't go wacko?I guess.. Stacey help. 
?	Recommend a ""like"" curve to map R20 to so that we can get around zero price issues?  Realize that mapping will include entire term structure and not just for the reference dates with zero price.
?	Other ideas?

I appreciate your help in working toward a solution.

Subject: DJ Calif Pwr Producers Urge FERC Reject Price Cap Petition 





12:15 GMT 15 August 2000
DJ Calif Pwr Producers Urge FERC Reject Price Cap Petition  (This article
was originally published Monday)  WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--California power
producers urged federal regulators Monday to reject a petition for price
caps in the state, arguing that intervention in the market would be
counterproductive by discouraging needed investment in new power supplies.
The petition was filed Aug. 2 with the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission by San Diego Gas & Electric Co., a unit of Sempra Energy (SRE).
It alleges that California's first-in-the-nation competitive power market
suffers from design and structural problems.  Surging power prices plaguing
the state this summer ""do not reflect legitimate forces of supply and
demand,"" SDG&E said, calling on FERC to impose across-the-board electricity
price caps in California of $250 per megawatt-hour indefinitely until the
market flaws are corrected.  But the power producers rejected SDG&E's
analysis of the market problems as ""simplistic,"" and called the imposition
of price caps on all California power sales an unwarranted response to the
power supply shortage.  ""SDG&E asks the commission to take unreasonable and
unprecedented action that would effectively rescind every California
supplier's authority to sell energy and ancillary services at market-based
rates,"" complained Southern Energy California, a subsidiary of Southern Co.
(SO).  ""A strict cap will only exacerbate the current supply shortages in
California,"" Southern Energy and the other power suppliers argued.  ""The
imposition of this cap by FERC may discourage power developers from choosing
to serve California markets,"" said Dynegy Power Marketing Inc. (DYN).  ""The
cap may also convince (electricity users they) need not participate in
load-reduction programs, since paying the $250 price cap is cheaper than
shedding load,"" Dynegy told the commission.  ""The imposition of caps on
every California market, and the increased uncertainty as to when - if ever
- they might be removed, sends precisely the wrong message to potential
suppliers of energy in California,"" Southern Energy said.  The arguments of
the individual power producers in the state were echoed by the Electric
Power Supply Association, the national trade group representing competitive
power producers and marketers.  Imposing price caps in California's volatile
electricity prices would ""suffocate markets"" and do nothing to address the
chronic power-supply shortages causing prices to spike, EPSA told FERC.
""The relief SDG&E seeks would actually prolong and intensify California's
difficulties,"" EPSA said.  Price caps would discourage electricity imports
and investment in new power plants to supply the state, while discouraging
price risk management, liquidity and accurate price signals, EPSA said.
FERC has already allowed the California Independent System Operator to cap
the price it is willing to pay for power, which it uses to assure the grid
operates properly and to make up ""energy imbalances"" on the system.  The ISO
recently lowered its purchase price cap to $250 per megawatt-hour. The SDG&E
petition asks FERC to extend that cap to the state's power exchange, or PX,
which operates as a clearinghouse for wholesale power sales in California.
""A PX bid cap is unnecessary because the ISO purchase price cap has
historically acted as a de facto cap on the PX markets,"" Dynegy told FERC.

          2002            demand down approximately 900 mmcf/d
          2003            demand will be flat
          2004            growth in demand will begin
          2005-2006   return to 2001 demand levels

Reasoning:
   2001 was a dry year - the lack of hydro generation created an additional 600 mmcf/d demand for gas in California
   Anticipated generation capacity overbuild in California - new more efficient power plants with better heat rates will displace older gas fired generation, reducing the amount of gas              required to generate a MW of electricity on the margin
   California electricity rate increases have curtailed demand for power and subsequently, gas

Gas transmission capacity into the state

Over the next two to three years there will be an additional 2.0 Bcf/d of transmission capacity into California
   800 mmcf/d in 2002
   900 mmcf/d in 2003 (Kern River expansion)
   300 mmcf/d               (El Paso conversion of All American oil line and power up)

San Juan basin gas

San Juan basin production is declining

   first half of 2001 vs. first half of 2000 production off by approximately 200 mmcf/d
   Rockies gas will not replace declining production in the San Juan San Juan gas will move closer to Permian pricing


The consultants believe that the combination of these factors will put decontracting pressure on existing transmission into the state of California, and especially the El Paso and Transwestern lines.

However, the ""wild card"" in their view is unforeseen California power demand growth.

As we discussed, JPMorgan would like to hear your views on the above issues.

Please give me a call when you have had sufficient time to digest and we can set up a conference call to make the most efficient use of your time.

Thanks Rod

As I have discussed with you, Citizens is concerned about the frequency of upstream supply issues that have resulted in the recent cuts in the deliveries to the Griffith power plant.  Based on the information I have received, the reasons for these cuts have not risen to the level of Force Majeure, which as you know is the only event that would excuse performance under our contract for firm delivery of gas.  Citizens therefore requests that Enron respond to Citizens in writing with a descriptions of the steps Enron is taking to insure that there is not a continuation of these contract performance issues into the future. Your prompt attention to this matter is appreciated.  "

I have been asked to do three or more additional CA's for equipment:

We did the attached CA for NRG (""...in connection with discussions concerning

Dear Mr Delainey:

We met in the Associate Orientation last summer when you asked me if I would 
like to join ENA for my first rotation. But since our first rotation was
assigned instead of chosen by ourselves, I was in no position to accept your 
kindly invitation. Now that I am two months away from finishing my
first rotation, I remembered our conversation during the Orientation and was 
more than eager to send you this  email hoping that your invitation is
still open.

I would love to join ENA (EA).  I believe by doing so, I will be given the 
opportunity to work with the smartest people in this industry.
I also believe I am prepared to join the trading unit in ENA.  I have five 
years' experience in Metals trading - both physical and financial. At
business school at UT Austin, I chose Energy Finance as my concentration and 
enjoyed tremendously these courses:

Risk management: Swap, Options, Delta and Vega hedge,...
Financial Strategy for Energy Companies: Financial decisions on investment 
and long-term hedge, ...
Financial Engineering: Case studies on financial products invented by 
Investment banks
Real Option Valuation: Decision making process considering the optionality in 
the future
Energy Law: Regulation and Environment issues in Energy Industry.

All this above and my passion for this industry and Enron  give me confidence 
to explore the opportunity to work in ENA. Only if you could
give me five minutes of your precious time to allow me to prove my 
qualifications, I will greatly appreciate it.

Have another  great year!

"Another ""unusual"" thought (subject to usual MG concerns):  Could we move the 
NYMEX trades out of ENA's name and have the MG entity ""own"" the trades for 
itself as a clearing member thereby allowing MG to post 50% LCs on its own 
trades?  MG would not be acting as our clearing broker but for their own 
account.   Of course, we would have to verify that this would work and 
consider regulatory oversight issues.

Tough talk on energy: Many Democratic lawmakers push to seize generators.
By Jim Sanders
BEE CAPITOL BUREAU
(Published April 16, 2001) 
Here's what some California lawmakers see as a trump card in solving the 
state's energy crisis: Gouge the public, lose your power plant. 
Faced with growing bills and dwindling options, many Democratic lawmakers are 
pushing for the use of emergency powers or eminent domain to force power 
generators to negotiate lower wholesale electricity prices. 
""Step One is to seize a few power plants,"" said Senate President Pro Tem John 
Burton, D-San Francisco. ""That would let (the generators) know we mean 
business."" 
""There's no negotiation when generators say, 'Pay us what we want, or we'll 
shut off California's lights,' "" said Phil Angelides, state treasurer. ""We 
ought to levy an excess profit tax, and if they don't take their foot off our 
throat, seize a plant or two to sober them up."" 
The increasingly tough talk about seizing assets, while motivated by an 
immediate desire to extract concessions, fits into a longer-term push for 
California to produce some of its own electricity to boost supply and protect 
against spiraling prices. 
Critics blast the notion of seizure, however, as a bargaining ploy or 
political grandstanding. 
""It's actually quite silly and a waste of time to consider these options,"" 
said Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, an 
association of wholesale generators. 
""Seizure would mean the state would pay top dollar for an Edsel -- old, tired 
plants that are past their prime,"" he said. ""What happens if these people are 
wrong and they're taking the people of California down a dead end?"" 
But others say the time is ripe for radical reform, with the state paying up 
to $50 million a day for electricity and facing prospects of rolling power 
blackouts this summer. 
""The generators will only respond when we take their golden eggs: the plants 
they own,"" said Douglas Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer 
Rights. ""They're the ones cheating us, and they're the ones we must target."" 
Lawmakers have raised the following two seizure possibilities, each aimed at 
ensuring that more electricity is available at lower than spot-market prices: 
Take over private power plants, perhaps contract with utilities to run them 
and let the courts decide what fair market price should be paid to the 
companies that now own them. 
Leave the plants alone, but seize their contracts with marketers, thus 
controlling where the power is sold while reducing price markups by 
eliminating the middleman in spot-market transactions. 
State Sen. Debra Bowen, D-Marina Del Rey, chairwoman of the state Senate's 
Energy Committee, recently suggested a third way for California to acquire 
existing electricity assets, without seizing them: Purchase the entire 
Pacific Gas and Electric Co. in Bankruptcy Court. 
Such a move could benefit the state and keep PG&E property out of the hands 
of private companies that already have too much influence over the 
electricity market, Bowen said. 
All sides agree that takeovers would be an extraordinary, unprecedented 
intervention into California's electricity industry. 
But Burton said his support for seizures is ""very serious."" The state could 
pay acquisition costs through revenue from electricity sales, he said. 
""People make money on power plants,"" he said. ""It ain't like they're loss 
leaders."" 
Gov. Gray Davis hasn't ruled out the seizure of power generators' assets or 
the acquisition of PG&E. But such possibilities raise a million questions, 
ranging from taxpayer exposure to technical issues regarding use of any asset 
acquired, Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said. 
Seizure, in particular, can be a ""risky gamble"" that should not be done in 
haste, Maviglio said. Private companies targeted by the state could respond 
by withholding power or deciding not to invest in new plants at a time when 
California is scrambling for more electricity. 
""Clearly, the governor doesn't want to send a message that California doesn't 
want increased generation,"" Maviglio said. ""Even though generators are 
gouging us now, they're also the people that build plants."" 
While the Democratic governor has not committed himself to seizure, he 
supports legislation -- SB 6x -- written by Burton and supported by Angelides 
that would create a public power authority to construct state-owned plants 
and help finance conservation and renewable-energy projects. 
""The notion that we should let electricity be traded by profiteers like a 
sheer commodity is ludicrous and dangerous,"" Angelides said. ""Public power is 
the public's defense against the greed and dysfunction of a market run amok."" 
Power plants aren't cheap, but with the $5.2 billion it has spent or 
allocated since January to buy energy on the spot market, the state could 
generate enough electricity to serve more than 10 million homes. A 
1,000-megawatt plant burning natural gas would cost about $500 million, 
according to the California Energy Commission. 
""We ought never again be in the position of having no ability to control at 
least part of the supply and hedge the market,"" said Darrell Steinberg, 
D-Sacramento, a member of the Assembly's Energy Committee. 
S. David Freeman, general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and 
Power and an adviser to Davis, said he solidly supports building public 
plants. He likes the idea of a windfall profits tax but is less enthusiastic 
about asset seizures. 
""All those things are worth considering and they're part of a common theme: 
The state has to take control of its own destiny,"" Freeman said. ""We need to 
conserve and build our way out of this mess. The Lord helps those who help 
themselves."" 
But Republican legislators, who have long opposed Davis' efforts to buy 
statewide electricity transmission, think the state would be making a big 
mistake by seizing private plants or building its own. 
""There's no reason to believe the state of California can run the power 
business or the transmission business as good as, or better than, the private 
sector,"" said Assembly Republican leader Dave Cox of Fair Oaks. 
The concept of seizure is particularly controversial. 
""How far can you take this?"" Cox asked. ""If we have a natural gas shortage, 
do we then seize those pipelines?"" 
Jan Smutny-Jones of the Independent Energy Producers Association said state 
officials need to stop their ""constant haranguing of generators."" 
""Seizing private property didn't work in Cuba, and I don't think it would 
work in California,"" he said. 
Private electricity companies are investing billions to generate more power, 
and are running their plants as hard as possible to meet the crisis, 
Smutny-Jones said. 
Soaring electricity prices have been due largely to high demand, scarce 
supply, extremely high costs for natural gas to run turbines, and financial 
risks tied to the instability of PG&E and Southern California Edison, 
industry officials say. 
But state officials claim that market manipulation has contributed as well. 
The California Independent System Operator, which manages the statewide 
transmission grid, has accused power generators of overcharging Californians 
by $6.2 billion since May. 
In response, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission recently threatened to 
order generators to refund a portion of the contested charges, $134.8 
million, mostly covering state purchases in January and February. 
Tom Williams, a spokesman for Duke Energy Corp., a North Carolina-based 
company that operates four California power plants, said the company is 
spending $1.6 billion to upgrade and expand those facilities in an attempt to 
ease the energy crunch. 
State seizures would discourage investment and hurt the industry, Williams 
said. 
""The governor has said that two things need to happen: The state needs more 
supply and lower prices,"" he said. ""Seizing power plants would do nothing to 
help those two objectives."" 
Any attempt to take Duke's property through eminent domain would spark a 
lawsuit, Williams said. ""We would fight it vigorously, I can assure you, to 
ensure we got fair market value."" 
But Duke would not object to the state building power plants of its own, he 
said. 
""We support any effort, public or private, to add generation to California,"" 
he said. ""The state needs it -- and needs it fast.""

(Published April 16, 2001) 
Gray Davis is, by his own description, a cautious, incremental and 
consensus-oriented politician. One might expect, therefore, that he would be 
circumspect in what he says, as well as what he does. 
The state's energy crisis, however, is offering new evidence of Davis' odd, 
even inexplicable, penchant for saying things that don't square with either 
reality or sensibility. It's not the same as President Bush's malapropisms. 
Davis knows what he's saying; he just doesn't know, or doesn't care, how 
ludicrous his words strike others. 
Take, for example, something Davis said three years ago as he was announcing 
his candidacy for governor. In a feeble attempt to be inspiring -- not easy 
for a politician whose name captures his personality -- Davis quoted from an 
inscription engraved into a state office building. 
The inscription is ""Bring me men to match my mountains,"" but Davis changed it 
to ""Bring me people to match my mountains"" as a gesture to feminists, and 
then placed it on the wrong building. To Davis, being politically correct was 
more important than being accurate. 
Davis had been governor for just six months when he uttered something so 
outrageous that it continues to reverberate. In a meeting with newspaper 
editors in San Francisco, Davis castigated the Legislature, which is 
controlled by his fellow Democrats, as having ""a totally different view of 
the world than I do, totally different,"" and then added: ""People expect 
government to reflect the vision that I suggested. Nobody else in the 
Legislature ran statewide. Their job is to implement my vision. That is their 
job."" 
To put it mildly, legislators were miffed by this pungent whiff of 
megalomania, which also disregarded American concepts of government, and 
Davis had to do some serious fence-mending in subsequent weeks. But did he 
learn his lesson about saying things that implied he is the center of the 
political universe? Apparently not. 
Nine months later, Davis said much the same thing about the courts, telling 
reporters in Washington that he expects his appointees to the bench to follow 
his lead on the death penalty and other issues or resign. Davis said that 
""while they (judges) have to follow the law ( they're there because I 
appointed them and they need to keep faith with my electoral mandate."" 
Another round of explanations and clarifications followed. 
The governor has uttered so many odd, and ultimately unrealistic, statements 
about the energy crisis this year that a Republican group now collects and 
distributes them. In January, he pledged that ""there will be no rate 
increases,"" even though he and a state Public Utilities Commission controlled 
by his appointees now say hefty rate boosts are necessary. Repeatedly, he has 
declared that an end to the crisis was in sight, only to see the state 
plummet even further into the abyss. His promise of a short-term state power 
purchase program has now become an immense and prolonged drain on the state 
treasury. And projections of significant new power generation and 
conservation savings to get the state through the summer are being downgraded 
severely. 
During one particularly effusive period in late February, Davis said 
California is ""on the back side of the crisis,"" pledged that ""the combination 
of rapid efforts to put more megawatts on line and conservation will get us 
through the summer,"" and declared that the state is within a month of 
completing all the ""legislative fixes"" needed to settle the crisis. 
But perhaps Davis' most enduring February declaration was this one: ""Believe 
me, if I wanted to raise rates, I could have solved this problem in 20 
minutes."" Maybe that was true in February. But Davis continued to dither and 
the rates are being raised now without any indication that the crisis will go 
away anytime soon. Given his record, we should view all of Davis' 
pronouncements with a strong sense of skepticism.

Up the creek without power
By Kevin Yamamura
BEE CAPITOL BUREAU
(Published April 16, 2001) 
Assemblyman Dennis Cardoza was headed to a federal energy hearing in Boise, 
Idaho, on Tuesday to help save California from rolling power blackouts. 
But hours before the scheduled departure came an unexpected twist: a blackout 
of his own. 
Cardoza, a Merced Democrat, resides on a 36-foot Gulf Star watercraft 
anchored along the Sacramento River during the week. 
He and other lawmakers had planned to take a 5:30 a.m. chartered flight to 
Boise, which meant Cardoza had to rise by 4 a.m., said staff member Doug 
White. Sometime during the night, however, the juice cut out. 
While Cardoza woke up on time -- thanks to a battery-powered alarm clock -- 
he faced other problems. ""He had to take a really, really cold bath with 
bottled water,"" White said. 
In the end, Cardoza barely made the flight -- arriving at the airport just 
before the plane departed. 
White said Cardoza's boat, powered by a series of batteries like those found 
in cars, fell victim to vandalism. 
$%&#@@&%$ timecards!!! 
Tensions apparently remain high at the Office of Criminal Justice Planning 
between some employees and their bosses. 
So high, in fact, that members of the California State Employees Association 
distributed leaflets Tuesday in front of the agency's office on the K Street 
Mall, criticizing management for what they consider to be high turnover rates 
and failed leadership. 
Some are particularly incensed about a new computer timekeeping system that 
tracks when they leave and where they go. Union President Perry Kenny said 
the system treats workers like ""inmates."" 
OCJP Chief Deputy Director Allen Sawyer said it is a response to a state 
audit issued two years ago that showed the agency lacked accountability for 
workers' time. He added that he feels managers have a ""great relationship"" 
with staff. 
An arbitrator is scheduled to review the matter in mid-June. 
The latest dispute follows criticism in December of OCJP Director Frank 
Grimes for allegedly using profanity in a mandatory meeting with staff. 
Grimes denied the claim, calling it a ""false allegation."" 
Bigger than a bowl game
The 1951 University of San Francisco football squad won nine games, lost none 
and is considered by many to be among the greatest college teams in history. 
But the Dons were snubbed by bowl game organizers because the team fielded 
two African American players. They stayed home while squads with blemished 
records -- including those they had beaten -- moved on to the postseason. 
To mark the team's 50th anniversary this fall, Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., 
has asked President Bush to honor the squad by inviting members to a White 
House ceremony. In particular, Boxer noted the team's integrity. 
""The team was offered the chance to compete without the African American 
players, but they unanimously refused on principle,"" she wrote. 
Jeff Logan, a Boxer spokesman, said the senator has not yet received a 
response from the president but expects to hear soon.

SDG&E has rebates for conservers of energy 




By Karen Kucher 
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER 
April 15, 2001 
Doris Tuley of El Cajon no longer switches on her TV during the day. She 
turns on so few lights she has to squint to read, and does her laundry only 
at night. 
""We are cutting back -- and yet the bill keeps going up,"" she said. 
Last week, Tuley, 63, found another way to save. She took six halogen 
torchiere lamps to La Mesa's Porter Hall to exchange for fluorescent lamps, 
which use less electricity. 

The replacements were free, provided by San Diego Gas & Electric Co. under an 
outreach program for seniors. 
It is one of many rebates and incentives offered by the utility, which is 
spending about $50 million to encourage residents and businesses to conserve 
energy. 
In the market for a new refrigerator? Consumers who purchase energy-saving 
models can pocket up to $125. Buying the right dishwasher could get you a $50 
rebate, while $75 is available for those who purchase qualified clothes 
washers. 
SDG&E also offers rebates for homeowners who install insulation, 
energy-efficient windows, new gas water heaters or energy-saving swimming 
pool pumps. Apartment building owners can get incentives to retrofit 
appliances in units, and developers who build homes that don't waste power 
can get money, too. 
The utility has offered programs promoting efficiency and conservation since 
the 1970s, with rebates and other costs covered by ratepayer fees, said Yole 
Whiting, SDG&E's director of consumer programs and services. 
Surge in interest
Such incentives have gained new importance in recent months, as skyrocketing 
prices and blackouts have become a reality for Californians. 
Consumers have been flooding the utility's Web site (http://www.sdge.com) and 
phone lines to find more information. 
""In the past, I can remember when it was hard to convince folks that they 
needed to save energy,"" Whiting said. ""We are getting a lot of response and a 
lot of interest now."" 
SDG&E is trying to encourage its customers to reduce total demand by 75 
megawatt-hours or more during 2001. 
If it creates a 23 megawatt-hour reduction and meets other goals, it will 
receive a $2.7 million incentive payment from the state Public Utilities 
Commission, Whiting said. 
The 23 megawatt-hours are enough to meet the demands of 17,250 households. 
Managers of stores that sell appliances say they have seen a rise in 
refrigerator sales in the first quarter of the year, which they believe is 
related to California's energy crisis. 
Consumers are particularly interested in finding appliances carrying the 
Energy Star label of the U.S. Department of Energy and U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency because those appliances save the most energy and qualify 
for rebates. 
""A lot of people don't understand Energy Star, but they do understand energy 
efficiency,"" said Harry Overlock, who manages the Sears store in El Cajon. 
Energy expert Michael Lamb said a 10-year-old refrigerator may use twice as 
much power as a new model. 
""Modern refrigerator technology has come a long way in 10 years,"" said Lamb, 
a certified energy manager at Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy 
Clearinghouse, a program operated by the U.S. Department of Energy. 
""As a general rule of thumb, a modern refrigerator of the same size with 
similar features will use about half the amount of power as one made about 10 
years ago, and about a third of the power of one made about 15 years ago. 
""The technology has just gotten a whole lot better,"" he said. 
Lamb said newer models offer better compressor motors and evaporation fan 
motors, more intelligent controls and better insulation. 
Shop carefully
Although those models can be more expensive, consumers like them because the 
rebate defrays some of the initial cost and because the long-term energy 
savings are attractive. 
However, a representative from the Utility Consumers' Action Network 
public-interest group warned consumers to research rebates before they shop 
for appliances. 
A UCAN intern who recently went to several local stores found that many 
salespeople seemed unfamiliar with rebate programs and didn't know what 
models qualified for them, said Jodi Beebe, an energy analyst with UCAN. 
""The best thing to do is do it with foresight,"" Beebe said. 
Sears' Overlock said he thinks rebates encourage consumers to replace 
inefficient appliances -- and he'd like to see more offered. 
Bill Walker, manager of the Home Depot in Grantville, says his customers are 
buying everything in the store related to energy efficiency. 
""Ever since the gas and electric bills have gone nuts, we are seeing a ton of 
energy-saving items from across the board (being bought). We can't keep 
insulation on the shelves,"" Walker said. 
""The energy-saving light bulbs are through the ceiling. We are up over 500 
percent on energy-saving light bulbs,"" he said. ""People are buying like 20 at 
a time and changing out their whole house."" 
The Home Depot sales aren't unusual. 
SDG&E says regional sales of energy-efficient light bulbs, which are 
subsidized by the utility company, exceeded projections for the first three 
months of the year. Funds for several rebates also are being drawn down 
quickly, although Whiting said there is no immediate danger of the utility 
ending any of the programs. 
""I would love to run out of money this year,"" she said. ""We are doing 
everything we can to get these funds into the hands of consumers.""

State energy officials push for San Jose power plant 



ASSOCIATED PRESS 
April 15, 2001 
SAN JOSE ) In an effort to ease this summer's promised power drain, state 
energy officials are pushing for approval of a proposed power plant in San 
Jose's Coyote Valley, despite recommendations that other sites may be more 
environmentally suitable, a newspaper reported Sunday. 
California Energy Commission top administrators undermined a negative 
environmental assessment of the project and recommended approval of Calpine 
Corp.'s Metcalf Energy Center over other sites, the San Jose Mercury News 
found, citing internal documents and transcripts obtained through a 
California Public Records Act request. 
But commission deputy director Bob Therkelsen denied any impartial dealings 
concerning the plant. 
""I would not deny that some of the staff have strong feelings,"" Therkelsen 
said . ""But I think the process allowed all perspectives to be heard."" 
San Jose City Council opposes the project because the city had planned to 
save the property for high-tech campuses. 
Commission administrators and attorneys directed an analyst to downplay other 
sites' advantages and quieted him at a hearing when he tried to voice his 
concerns over the pressure that prompted him to alter his findings, the 
newspaper found. The commission also reversed a third analyst's 
recommendation that Calpine obtain a contract for recycled water prior to 
construction, which could have slowed building the plant. 
A 574-page Preliminary Staff Assessment released in May identified other more 
""environmentally preferable"" sites, including two industrial sites in 
Fremont. 
Therkelsen said the report was a premature draft that changed as more 
information became available. 
""I was concerned that the alternatives were being portrayed more 
optimistically than realistically,"" Therkelsen said. 
Analyst Gary Walker, a 21-year veteran, reported other plant sites would be 
more suitable, but was later told his report was full of ""bias"" and 
""inconsistencies,"" the newspaper reported. 
In an e-mail, senior commission attorney Arlene Ichien said Metcalf must be 
cast in a better light or it would be hard for the commission to grant 
approval. 
""Staff is building a strong case for finding the alternative sites feasible,"" 
Ichien wrote. 
In a report last fall, Walker's discussion of other sites' advantages was 
ultimately replaced by a warning that the Silicon Valley is at risk for 
blackouts unless Metcalf is built. 
The final report recommended approval. 
Another analyst was told to change his report about how much noise the plant 
would create and the amount of insulation needed to quiet it, the newspaper 
reported. The analyst was taken off the project, and the final assessment 
released last October said insulation was not necessary because of the few 
homes near the plant. 
The five-member commission is expected to make its decision this summer 
during the power crisis' peak load. There is a push to build power plants in 
the technology-dominated Silicon Valley, which imports most of its 
electricity. The plant would use 3 million to 6 million gallons of water a 
day, but with San Jose officials opposed to the plant, it is unclear where 
that water would come from. 
Calpine and its development partner, Bechtel Enterprises, wants the plant 
operating by 2002.

PG&E sent hard-nosed proposal to Davis demanding no regulation 



ASSOCIATED PRESS 
April 15, 2001 
SAN FRANCISCO ) Pacific Gas and Electric Co. officials demanded the utility 
be cut free from state regulation and be allowed to push huge rate increases 
onto its customers, two weeks before negotiations with Gov. Gray Davis broke 
off, the San Francisco Chronicle reported Sunday. 
""Perhaps we misjudged their primary concern,"" said Steve Maviglio, the 
governor's spokesman. ""It wasn't resolving their credit issue. It was 
extracting vengeance on the PUC."" 
In addition to insisting that it be released from the state Public Utilities 
Commission's regulatory grip, PG&E demanded it be allowed to buy back its 
power lines without competitive offers if the state ever decided to sell. In 
addition, it wanted to continue profiting from any telecommunications lines 
or antennas linked to the system, according to a Feb. 28 eight-page proposal 
obtained by the Chronicle. 
PG&E denies the document influenced the outcome between the utility and the 
state. 
""It is ludicrous to suggest that this document caused the negotiations to 
break down,"" said PG&E spokesman Ron Low. ""There were negotiations that 
occurred later and other documents that followed."" 
At the time of the utility's bankruptcy filing April 6, PG&E Corp. Chairman 
Robert Glynn said no talks had been held for three weeks. PG&E's proposal had 
been delivered about two before talks ceased. 
PG&E has said it's entitled to recoup $9 billion it paid for wholesale power 
because of PUC-regulated rate caps, which kept the utility from passing high 
costs onto customers. 
The proposal said this money ""will be fully recovered in retail rates without 
further CPUC review for prudence or any other purpose,"" the Chronicle 
reported. 
The document went on to demand the PUC drop all proceedings concerning PG&E, 
including an investigation into whether the utility violated California law 
by transferring millions to parent company PG&E Corp. prior to filing 
bankruptcy. 
""They took a position on regulatory matters that was out of touch with 
reality,"" Maviglio said. 
PG&E Corp. spokesman Shawn Cooper declined to comment on the proposal. 
""That document is confidential,"" he said. 
Ratepayer advocates say they're baffled by PG&E's demands. 
""It's like the Japanese insisting that we surrender Hawaii after we beat them 
in World War II,"" said Harvey Rosenfield, consumer advocate for the 
Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights.

Some plants can, but won't, make power 



Too costly to run, they sit off-line
By Jonathan Heller 
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER 
April 14, 2001 
While San Diegans are being asked to turn off lights and wash dishes by hand 
because of the energy shortage, three power plants capable of supplying power 
for about 155,000 homes have sat idle for up to two weeks. 
The cogeneration plant at the Iceoplex skating complex in Escondido has been 
off-line since April 1 because a state agency that regulates its prices has 
set them so low it can't afford to produce electricity, a plant official said 
yesterday. 
Three other cogeneration plants at the North Island Naval Air Station, the 
Naval Training Center and the 32nd Street Naval Station also are off-line. 
Together, they can produce 155 megawatts, or about 5 percent of the county's 
total demand at this time of year. A megawatt is enough energy to power 750 
to 1,000 homes, depending on the time of year and other factors. 
Unlike conventional power generators, which can set their own prices under 
deregulation, cogeneration plants and other alternative power providers, such 
as wind and solar plants, sell power under a price formula set by the 
California Public Utilities Commission. 
The PUC changed the formula April 1, and since then cogenerators across the 
state have complained they can't recoup their costs under the new pricing 
system. 
""Anyone who can do math can figure out that losing money is no incentive to 
generate power,"" said Ann MacLeod, executive director of the California 
Cogeneration Council. 
This situation is different from the one that led Houston-based Dynegy Corp. 
to threaten to shut down its San Diego-area plants this week. Dynegy said it 
no longer wants to sell power because it is afraid the state is not able to 
pay the bill. 
The Iceoplex plant, operated by Purenergy Corp., produces just under 50 
megawatts, nearly enough to supply a city the size of Escondido. Jim 
Hinrichs, Purenergy's general manager in San Diego, said he did not know how 
long it would be shut down. 
""Our plant in Escondido is currently off-line until such time as we can 
procure gas at a price where we can cover our fuel costs,"" Hinrichs said. 
The three plants on the Navy bases, operated by Sithe Energies Corp., produce 
between 23 and 45 megawatts each. 
It was unclear why those plants were shut down. A spokesman for Sithe 
Energies could not be reached for comment late yesterday. 
The Naval Training Center plant went off-line April 2, the North Island plant 
on April 3 and the 32nd Street plant on April 6, according to the Independent 
System Operator, which manages the state's power grid. 
Those outages were unplanned, according to the Independent System Operator 
Web site. 
Stephanie McCorkle, an ISO spokeswoman, said she could not comment on why the 
plants were shut down. She did say that about half of all alternative power 
generators, including cogenerators, wind and solar plants, are currently 
off-line in the state. That translates to 3,000 megawatts, or enough energy 
for about 3 million homes. 
The four San Diego cogeneration plants are under contract to sell electricity 
to SDG&E, which feeds it into the regional power grid. 
""If they don't run, they don't get paid,"" said Art Larson, an SDG&E 
spokesman. ""That's one simple aspect of the contract."" 
There are other cogeneration plants in the county that are still operating, 
although most of them are much smaller than the four that are off-line. 
""During this period of demand shortfalls, we think it's in the best interest 
of the community that every available power generating source be up and 
operating,"" Larson said. 
James Loewen, a PUC analyst, acknowledged that the PUC's decision has 
resulted in lower payments to the cogenerators. He said the pricing formula 
and payments to cogenerators are tied to the cost of natural gas imported 
into California. 
The PUC changed the formula to one that would factor in gas coming in from 
the Oregon border, where prices are historically cheaper, he said. 
But cogenerators contend the new formula has made it uneconomical to turn on 
their plants. 
""It defies common sense,"" said MacLeod of the cogeneration council. ""We are 
hoping the PUC has become aware in the last month as how bad that decision 
was.""

FERC orders release of energy contracts 



Regulators' demand for secret deals riles Davis administration
By Toby Eckert?
COPLEY NEWS SERVICE 
April 14, 2001 
WASHINGTON -- Federal regulators have ordered power suppliers to turn over 
copies of their confidential short-term and long-term contracts with 
California, which the regulators intend to share with a congressional 
committee. 
In a letter sent to the power companies Thursday, the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission said it would ""treat these contracts as confidential"" 
unless the supplier waives confidentiality. 
It is unclear whether the House Government Reform Committee is under the same 
obligation, though FERC said the information would be given to the committee 
""under confidential seal."" 
Gov. Gray Davis has been keeping details of the contracts secret, arguing 
that revealing the information would weaken the state's bargaining position 
in negotiations with other suppliers. FERC's order angered the Davis 
administration, which fears the information will be leaked once it is in 
federal hands. 
""It just seems to me that FERC is trying to give generators more leverage,"" 
said Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio. ""The more information we release, the 
more Californians are going to have to pay."" 
FERC's letter to the 49 power suppliers came two days after Republican 
congressmen threatened to issue subpoenas for the contracts at a U.S. House 
Government Reform Committee hearing in Sacramento on the power crisis. 
""We want that information,"" Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., the committee chairman, 
told California Public Utilities Commission President Loretta Lynch. 
So do California news organizations -- including The San Diego Union-Tribune 
-- and Republican state lawmakers, who have filed separate suits to get it. 
The California Department of Water Resources has been buying power on behalf 
of the state's cash-strapped utilities. FERC said it wanted to see the 
contracts ""to determine how successful efforts have been to fashion long-term 
contracts and to reduce reliance on spot markets,"" where electricity prices 
are typically higher. 
FERC issued an order Dec. 15 designed to encourage long-term contracts and 
bring some stability to California's chaotic power market. 
The letter to the power companies said FERC ""intends to provide copies of the 
contracts to the Committee on Government Reform under confidential seal."" 
A FERC spokeswoman said she was unsure whether that meant the committee would 
be obligated to keep the information secret. She referred the question to the 
committee. A spokesman for the committee could not be reached for comment. 
FERC gave the power suppliers until the close of business Monday to file the 
contract copies. 
Meanwhile, for the second time this week, Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham 
defended the Bush administration's response to the California crisis. Critics 
have blistered the administration for refusing to consider price controls on 
wholesale electricity. 
In a letter to members of Congress and California legislators released by the 
Energy Department on Friday, Abraham outlined 11 steps the administration and 
FERC have taken, such as ordering federal agencies to expedite permits for 
new power plants and asking power providers to do everything they can to 
avoid disruptions this summer. 
""Regrettably, our well-founded opposition to price caps has been claimed by 
some to suggest the administration either does not care about California and 
the West or is doing nothing to address the problem,"" Abraham wrote. 
Abraham made similar comments when briefing reporters Monday on the Energy 
Department's proposed budget for fiscal year 2002.

Escondido, San Marcos may be power partners 



Cities seeking way to forge rate deals
By Jonathan Heller 
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER 
April 14, 2001 
ESCONDIDO -- After months of tiptoeing around the idea of working with San 
Marcos to buy cheap energy, the Escondido City Council might be ready to get 
serious. 
On Wednesday, the council is expected to direct City Manager Rolf Gunnarson 
to initiate a formal working arrangement with San Marcos officials on a 
project to seek inexpensive, stable energy rates. 
""The time for talking is over,"" said City Councilwoman June Rady. 
Rady approached San Marcos City Councilman Lee Thibadeau in January with the 
idea of the two cities working together. That was before Sempra Energy 
Resources made public its plans to build a 500-megawatt power plant in 
Escondido. 
Now Rady believes that the two cities can join forces and forge a deal with 
Sempra to nail down inexpensive electricity rates. Sempra officials have said 
they're willing to discuss possible rate deals with the city. 
If the council votes to move forward with the cooperative plan, Gunnarson 
would take the lead with San Marcos City Manager Rick Gittings. 
""I would propose to work closely with Mr. Gittings as well as the city 
attorney's office, and with legal and technical consultants, to develop 
policy options for the council to consider,"" Gunnarson wrote in a report to 
the council. 
To buy power directly, instead of through a utility such as San Diego Gas & 
Electric, a city has to adopt a special legal arrangement, such as forming a 
municipal utility district. San Marcos has done that, but it would be a more 
lengthy process for Escondido. San Marcos is a charter city and has more 
flexibility under the state Constitution. Escondido is a general law city. 
Escondido, however, might have the option of forming a joint-powers authority 
with San Marcos to buy power. 
Gittings said in a letter to Escondido officials that he believes the Sempra 
proposal is an excellent opportunity for both cities. 
""The project may possibly alleviate the power requirements of our two cities 
and provide a much-needed generating facility in the northeastern portion of 
the county,"" Gittings said. 
The Sempra plant would be built in Quail Hills in the southwestern part of 
Escondido, not far from the San Marcos boundary. 
Sempra has had several meetings with Escondido officials and residents, but 
has not yet submitted a formal proposal.

Davis promises energy crisis won't cost voters 'one penny' 



ASSOCIATED PRESS 
April 14, 2001 
LOS ANGELES ) Gov. Gray Davis promised that taxpayers will end up spending 
""not one penny"" on the energy crisis because struggling utilities will repay 
billions of dollars the state treasury has spent to keep the lights on. 
""We will not only be paid for all our expenses to date, we'll have enough ... 
to continue buying power through this year and hopefully 2002,"" Davis told 
the Los Angeles Times on Friday. 
But the governor also admitted California still faces possible blackouts this 
summer, especially during hot spells when air conditioners will be running 
full blast. 
Davis has asked state lawmakers to approve spending another $500 million to 
buy power for bankrupt Pacific Gas and Electric and credit-poor Southern 
California Edison, bringing his total requests to $5.2 billion. 
The governor, however, said he expected the state money to be repaid by early 
2003 under his plan to float $12.4 billion in bonds. The bonds, to be issued 
in June, would be repaid by utility ratepayers. 
The governor's plan, which was approved by the Legislature, was adopted with 
hopes that the state could negotiate long-term contracts with power suppliers 
and eventually stabilize prices. Those lower prices have yet to materialize, 
and state Treasurer Phil Angelides has raised questions about the plan in 
recent weeks. 
Davis also said he inherited the power crunch. 
He was state controller in 1996 when the state Legislature was discussing 
utility deregulation but ""I basically wasn't asked to take a position and I 
didn't take a position,"" Davis said. ""I didn't give it much thought."" 
He also blamed the crunch on out-of-state wholesale electricity producers. 
They have gouged California utilities and are ""the biggest snakes on the 
planet Earth,"" the governor said. 
But he reserved most of the blame for the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission, calling it ""the culprit"" in the crisis. Davis said the commission 
has refused to cap wholesale prices, and as early as 1995 turned down state 
requests to build more power plants. 
On Friday, California's power grid operator called on the federal commission 
to increase the amount of money it ordered electricity generators to refund 
last month. The California Independent System Operator has said power 
generators have overcharged utilities billions of dollars more than the $124 
million in January and February power sales questioned by the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission so far.

Utilities to Resume Paying Producers 

Electricity: Some small companies that provide power say the new rate plans 
are not enough to get them back online. 

By JULIE TAMAKI, Times Staff Writer 

?????SACRAMENTO--The state's two biggest utilities are scheduled to resume 
paying hundreds of small power producers this week, but at least some 
producers say they plan to remain offline.
?????Jay Henneberry, an attorney representing a small gas-fired power plant 
in Oxnard, said his client does not plan to start generating electricity 
again for Southern California Edison today, because of a controversial new 
rate plan that he said would force his client to operate at a loss.
?????The company, EF Oxnard Inc., sued Edison last week, alleging that the 
utility owes it more than $13.5 million for past electricity deliveries. The 
lack of payment, according to EF Oxnard officials, prompted natural gas 
suppliers to cut them off in February, forcing Oxnard to stop producing 
electricity.
?????Henneberry noted that the new rate plan fails to address the utilities' 
past debt to producers, which who are collectively owed more than $1.8 
billion.
?????""Those payments are only on a going-forward basis,"" Henneberry said. 
""They do nothing for $13.5 million owed to my client.""
?????The situation underscores the problems the state faces as it tries to 
get California's nearly 700 producers of alternative and renewable energy 
paid and, in cases such as EF Oxnard, back in business.
?????These companies, which include producers of solar, wind and thermal 
power, provide more than a quarter of the electricity consumed in California. 
But their output has been cut by as much as half in recent weeks due in part 
to the payment problems.
?????A new rate plan approved by the Public Utilities Commission last month 
to help get those producers paid has triggered a growing number of gas-fired 
power producers to sue Pacific Gas & Electric and Edison to get out of their 
contracts with the utilities. The power suppliers say the new rate plan would 
force them to operate at a loss, because it does not adequately compensate 
them for rising natural gas costs.
?????""We are not going to run our plants if we can't run them profitably,"" 
said Marty Quinn, executive vice president and chief operating officer of 
Ridgewood Power LLC, which owns three small gas-fired generators in 
California that are not operating.
?????In a related matter, a hearing is scheduled today in a legal battle 
between Edison and a small geothermal producer. An Imperial County judge 
previously freed CalEnergy from its contract with Edison because of the 
utility's failure to pay the company, which has since been selling its 
supplies on the wholesale power market.
?????The court is expected to rule today on CalEnergy's request for roughly 
$100 million in payments it is owed by Edison, and could also act on an 
Edison request that Cal- Energy be required to resume selling power to the 
utility.
?????""If Edison shows that it is credit-worthy and capable of making payments 
on a going-forward basis, I'm sure the judge will take that into account,"" 
said CalEnergy official Jonathan Weisgall. ""But one of our concerns is how 
long will Edison continue to make these payments.""
?????An official with Sierra Pacific Industries, which received court 
permission earlier this month to sell power generated by six plants it owns 
in California to a buyer other than PG&E, said Sierra Pacific does not plan 
to resume transmitting electricity to the utility.
?????""From our point of view we have terminated those contracts,"" said Bob 
Ellery, Sierra Pacific's director of energy resources.
?????Henneberry said he doubts that Edison plans to pay EF Oxnard because the 
new rate arrangement covers only deliveries made in April and beyond.
?????An Edison spokesman said his company sent payments totaling $206 million 
to small producers Friday, but said he did not know whether checks were sent 
to producers that have gone offline. A spokesman for PG&E estimates that the 
monthly bill to small producers will total $200 million to $400 million.
?????Ridgewood, Oxnard and Sierra Pacific generate a total of 140 megawatts 
of electricity, or enough power to serve more than 105,000 typical homes. 
State officials have at times been forced to replace the lost deliveries by 
purchasing power on the pricey wholesale and spot markets.
?????The California Independent System Operator, which oversees the state's 
power grid, said it received about 3,800 megawatts of power Friday from small 
producers, compared to the 6,000 megawatts the small producers usually 
deliver. In recent weeks the group's output has dipped as low as 3,000 
megawatts.

Tariff May Limit Flow of Natural Gas 

Power: A tax designed to protect the Gas Co. may be stifling efforts to ship 
more of the fuel needed by many California generators. 

By CHRISTINE HANLEY, Times Staff Writer 

?????Two projects aimed at boosting the capacity of California's natural gas 
delivery network are stalled by a little-known tariff that power companies 
would have to pay to use the new pipelines.
?????The tax was established six years ago by the Public Utilities Commission 
and requires electricity generators and other natural gas customers to pay an 
extra fee if they use pipelines not controlled by Southern California Gas Co.
?????At the time, officials as well as consumer advocates believed the tariff 
would protect the firm's residential and small business owners.
?????But amid California's energy crisis, some officials contend that the 
tariff is preventing the state from boosting pipeline capacity at a time when 
more natural gas is desperately needed to fuel power plants.
?????California, which makes more than half its electricity from natural gas, 
has not expanded its gas distribution network in eight years. Experts warn 
that the system is running close to capacity and that easing constraints is a 
crucial step in any rescue plan.
?????Two companies are trying to add capacity: Questar wants to convert an 
old oil pipeline that runs 700 miles underground from New Mexico to Long 
Beach, and Williams Co. wants to push its existing Kern River-Mojave pipeline 
farther west, also to Long Beach.
?????But both companies said they are having trouble signing up customers 
because power companies don't want to pay the tariff.
?????Watson Cogeneration Co., which operates a 400-megawatt generator in Los 
Angeles County, is considering using Questar's pipelines but said it cannot 
complete any deal until the tariff issue is resolved.
?????""With the state building all these new gas-fired plants, the question I 
have is, where are they going to get the gas?"" said Pat King, executive 
director of the firm.
?????Questar, Williams Co. and other energy companies have been fighting the 
tariff in a series of hearings before the PUC. Last year, the commission 
concluded that the tariff may discourage the construction of badly needed new 
power plants in Southern California and asked the Gas Co. to develop a new 
pricing system.
?????But the issue was reassigned earlier this year to a new administrative 
law judge as the commission reshuffled its load to handle more pressing 
energy emergencies. That judge does not expect a final ruling any time soon.
?????""The case is in limbo,"" said Carol Brown, the judge, who must sift 
through years of transcripts before writing a draft decision. She predicted 
that ""we might all be old and gray"" by the time a final vote is taken by the 
full commission.
?????Enacted in 1995, the so-called Residual Load Service tariff can levy 
massive penalties against Gas Co. customers who choose an alternate 
distributor but later have to return to the company's network.
?????If service on a competing pipeline is interrupted, a power plant that 
had to switch back to the Gas Co. for a day of deliveries could be charged 
what it would cost to reserve that capacity for an entire year.
?????For many power plants, the risk of leaving the Gas. Co. with the tariff 
in place is simply too high.
?????""If there's any risk that that might happen, there's no way you're going 
to sign up for another pipeline, because you'd end up paying twice for 
natural gas service,"" said Tom Beach, a former PUC staffer and a consultant 
for Crossborder Energy who testified against the tariff. ""It just shows how 
punitive this rate is and how it discourages people from bringing in new 
pipelines and trying to compete with SoCal Gas.""
?????Critics charge that the tariff is so punitive that not a single power 
supplier has left Southern California Gas.
?????The tariff was approved with ratepayers in mind--and actually was 
heavily endorsed by consumer activists. Without it, they said, Southern 
California Gas could pass on any loss in business from competing pipelines to 
its residential and other core customers.
?????Still, Pacific Gas & Electric Co., California's other top gas utility, 
has never requested such a tariff to protect its Northern California 
territory from competitors.
?????But as PG&E itself points out, the market is more competitive in 
Southern California, where four of the five major interstate pipelines 
serving California cross the state border.
?????""We never felt we needed it,"" said Staci Homrig, a PG&E spokeswoman. 
""There's not the same competitive situation up here as there is down there.""
?????The Gas Co. says the tariff is necessary to prevent power plants from 
shopping around for the best pipeline deal and then using the company's lines 
as a backup system during emergencies. The company said that could disrupt 
service to its regular customers.
?????""It's not really economical to have our facilities standing by--not 
being used--and not being paid for it,"" said Steve Rahon, a Gas Co. 
regulatory manager. ""They want our facilities to be ready in case they can't 
receive all of their load from the Questar pipeline. We want this tariff to 
be able to charge a fair price for that.""
?????Furthermore, the utility says, its customers need to be protected from 
higher rates and the utility needs to be able to compete on a level playing 
field with interstate pipelines that play by different pricing and delivery 
rules.
?????The pipeline companies agree that bypass customers should pay a price 
for swinging back and forth between providers. But they argue that the 
existing tariff is so high it is preventing fair competition. As proof of 
that, they say, energy companies have resisted siting power plants in the Gas 
Co.'s territory. What's more, the tariff has never been triggered.
?????""It's important to note that no one has ever taken service under this 
rate because it's such a risk,"" Beach said.
?????During a rate proceeding last year, the PUC found that ""gas supply 
competition is critical to the economic survival of both existing and new 
electric generators"" and agreed that the tariff may be discouraging the 
siting of new power plants in the Los Angeles Basin.
?????The commission ordered Southern California Gas to come up with a new 
pricing system that must ""not be the equivalent"" of the old one. The Gas Co. 
has proposed two alternative rate structures, both of which do not impress 
the pipeline companies.
?????It will be up to Brown, the administrative law judge, to choose between 
the Gas Co.'s proposals and those suggested by opposing parties. She could 
also suggest yet another rate, or repeal the existing tariff altogether.
?????""I need to write a decision. And that's kind of a daunting project,"" 
said Brown, who inherited the case in January.
?????""I really can't give you a projection,"" she said. ""It's one of those 
things that if the commission decides it's incredibly important and needs it 
done, it will be moved to the top of my list. And that order could come at 
any time or it might never come.""

Experts Doubtful About Rush to Build Small Power Plants
Energy: State wants ,peaker, units to fill 40% of summer gap. But various 
factors make that seem unlikely.
By TIM REITERMAN, Times Staff Writer
?????Gov. Gray Davis has mobilized state government and invited developers to 
put dozens of small +peaker+ power plants online +at warp speed+ to help 
avert blackouts this summer.
?????But, as California races against time, industry experts say the 
logistics and uncertainties of power plant construction make it doubtful the 
state will have as much peaker electricity as it is seeking:
?????Generating turbines--which resemble giant jet engines--are in tight 
supply. Design, engineering, construction and testing take several months. 
And community opposition is sometimes a concern because the plants can be 
noisy and add to air pollution.
?????Without knowing how much people will conserve, state officials estimate 
the summer energy shortage at about 5,000 megawatts--enough to serve 3.7 
million homes. They are counting on emergency peaking plants, usually 
providing 50 to 100 megawatts each, to make up about 40% of that shortfall.
?????But records and interviews with energy experts, state officials and 
potential plant developers show that:
?????* A contracting program the state hopes will bring in about 1,100 
megawatts of peaking power has been stalled for weeks. Officials are still 
negotiating with about 10 developers and are uncertain how much power will be 
available for summer.
?????* An effort begun last year to issue plant permits within four months 
led to approval of only one 50-megawatt plant at San Francisco International 
Airport. Officials there say the deal is collapsing. Half a dozen other plant 
applications were withdrawn due to site problems, including pollution.
?????* The state,s new accelerated 21-day permit approval program is far from 
meeting Davis, goal of getting plants capable of producing an additional 
1,000 megawatts in operation for the summer.
?????The California Energy Commission approved two projects, and five more 
are being reviewed, for a total of about 500 megawatts. State officials 
concede that not all the power will be available the entire summer because 
developers have until Sept. 30--after summer ends--to get plants online.
?????During a recent workshop to promote the construction of peaker plants, 
Roger Johnson of the energy commission said the panel is tracking an 
additional 900 megawatts worth of plant proposals that developers are 
expected to file in April.
?????+It is possible we can meet the goal,+ he said, adding that Southern 
California Edison has 20 requests for new power plant hookups totaling an 
additional 1,665 megawatts.
?????Can those proposed Southern California plants, most of them designed to 
run during times of peak electricity demand, be ready for the summer?
?????+We don,t think so,+ said Ronald D. Nunnally, director of federal 
regulation and contracts in Edison,s transmission and distribution unit. 
+There,s a lot of hurdles. . . . A workshop [like this] would be more useful 
for next summer.
?????+Anything not in the process now has [only] a remote chance of being 
online this summer,+ he said in a remark echoed by a number of plant 
developers. +Chances are slim.+

?????,People Can,t Seem to Move,
?????The 
state reserved a cavernous auditorium at an Ontario hotel March 29 for what 
was billed as a workshop and +energy fair.+ About 50 potential developers, 
consultants and sellers of power turbines attended. And many, while praising 
the state,s efforts to encourage deal-making and streamline permitting, had 
no deals on the horizon, let alone in the works.
?????+People can,t seem to move,+ said Los Angeles consultant and developer 
Bob Hoffman, who attended the conference to sell a Japanese turbine that 
could power a peaker plant. +I talked to people with great projects. It doesn,
t seem to be congealing.+
?????After two weeks on the California market, the 
turbine was later sold for use in a plant in Nigeria.
?????To encourage plant development, the state has compressed the permit 
process. It has offered to quickly contract to purchase power. It has helped 
prospective developers find smog credits, which allow them to emit air 
pollutants for a price per ton. And it has enlisted major utilities in 
quickly hooking up proposed plants to natural gas lines that fuel them and to 
the grid that carries electricity to users.
?????+Nobody has ever moved this rapidly, still being mindful of all 
environmental standards, to put power online,+ Davis told The Times, 
editorial board Friday.
?????The energy commission has also developed a list of potential peaker 
plant sites that have a minimum of two acres and proximity to gas and 
electricity infrastructure.
?????The commission identified the San Francisco Bay Area, parts of the 
Central Valley and San Diego as the regions most in need of peaking power 
plants, but said the Los Angeles region could also benefit.
?????Thirty-two sites with a potential for producing 1,700 to 3,400 megawatts 
of peaking power passed the initial screening for suitability, according to a 
Feb. 21 report. They ranged from a soap factory in Sacramento County and a 
paper mill in Ontario to the former Ft. Ord army base near Monterey and the 
Pitchess Honor Ranch in Los Angeles County.
?????The only project approved under the four-month permitting program 
initiated after outages last summer was El Paso Merchant Energy Co.,s 
proposed United Golden Gate plant, which would provide about 50 megawatts to 
San Francisco International Airport. +The deal is not dead but it,s near 
dead,+ said airport spokesman Ron Wilson. +We,re looking for another 
supplier.+ Company spokeswoman Kim Wallace said the firm still hopes to make 
a deal.
?????The California Independent System Operator contracted with developers of 
about 29 peaker plants last year, but the state Department of Water 
Resources, which has been buying power since mid-January, is renegotiating 
longer pacts. +We will try to get as many as we can for this summer,+ said 
Vijay Patel of the department. +They are all in play.+
?????The new 
contracts, he said, will be for five to 10 years and allow plants to run 
several thousand hours a year--far more than peaking plants commonly do. The 
companies, he said, would be free to sell power on the open market after they 
fulfilled their power sales contracts to California.
?????+These will run in peak periods and any time we need to call for power,+ 
said energy commission spokesman Rob Schlichting. +Maybe we should call them 
Stage 3 power plants.+
?????When The Times contacted owners of about 20 plant 
sites on the state list, few said they had deals or solid proposals for 
construction. Many were fielding calls from owners of turbines and potential 
developers who had seen their names on a state Web site.
?????+We,re on the list but don,t belong there,+ said Dave Rib, manager of a 
solar plant in Boron. +We are the largest solar plant in the world. We,re 
here in the Mojave Desert. We do not develop plants, and we have no plans to. 
Maybe [the energy commission] will find a developer.+

?????Exploring Several 
Sites
?????Several sites are being explored by Calpine, which has 11 turbines and a 
contract to provide 495 megawatts to the state, starting with 90 in August. 
The proposed peaker locations are in Northern California. Spokesman Bill 
Highlander said the company will not divulge more precise locations until a 
feasibility study is finished.
?????In Solano County, a peaker has been in planning since last summer at 
Lambie Industrial Park, named after nearby pastures with lambs.
?????Hal Mitchell, a principal of Sterling Energy, said the plant will 
produce 147 megawatts and could be running by September. +We have a client 
who wanted to put some assets in the ground,+ he said. +Coincidentally the 
big crunch came along. [It] would have been built despite the energy crisis.
?????+We,ve been getting all kinds of calls, people selling equipment, people 
trying to buy projects, and flakes,+ Mitchell added. +Some say, ,I got five 
acres on top of a mountain. How ,bout building me a power plant?, +
?????Phil 
Consiglio, vice president of Merit Energy Systems in Burbank, said he is 
close to contracting with a developer at Ft. Ord, a former military base that 
now houses Cal State Monterey, among other things. +There is an area 
scheduled for utility usage,+ he said. +We found an area where they are 
removing contaminated water [from the ground] and cleaning it. It,s not 
potable, but we can use it for a power plant.
?????+It will not be up and running for the summer.+
?????Two oil production 
facilities in Inglewood and Montebello are on the list. Steve Rusch, manager 
of government affairs for Stocker Resources Inc., said three developers are 
interested in one of the sites. But he said he is skeptical that such sites 
can be turned into plants by summer. +The biggest issue is land use,+ he 
said. + ,Not in my backyard., . . . Another thing is that pollution offsets 
are tough to get. The reins need to be loosened up.+
?????A Stocker site in 
San Luis Obispo County is on a list of more than 100 other potential sites 
that state officials say require further evaluation. These include a soup 
factory and a former nuclear power plant.
?????Some sites were found to have +fatal flaws+ because they were too near 
habitat of endangered species such as the fairy shrimp. Numerous sites are 
hydroelectric facilities owned by Pacific Gas & Electric Co. in mountainous 
areas far from gas lines necessary to fuel them.
?????Anticipated community resistance was listed as a problem with a site in 
Morro Bay, where Duke Energy is already expanding a full-size power plant.
?????+This [listing] is news to me,+ said Duke spokesman Tom Williams. +We 
can,t even burp in Morro Bay without a permit.+
?????Mark Seedaal, Duke,s 
director of electrical modernization, said it would probably take the company 
nine months to design, install and get on the grid even a small peaker plant 
of 50 megawatts. +You don,t just drive up on a truck, put it down and drive 
away,+ he said. +I don,t see how you can do it by the summer of 
2001.+
?????The Sacramento Municipal Utility District has an existing 
cogeneration plant at a Procter & Gamble factory and is already building a 
peaker scheduled to begin operation in May.
?????+We,re a little confused as to why we,re on the state list,+ said 
spokesman Greg Fishman. So how long did the district,s peaker take to build? 
+It is a seven- or eight-month process to do the actual construction,+ he 
said. +And . . . getting the parts is often a yearlong process.+
?????One 
site on the state list is in Redding, where the municipal utility district 
broke ground on a 43-megawatt plant that was two years in the planning and 
will not be finished much before summer of 2002.
?????+The state would like to take some credit, but it is all the city of 
Redding,+ said Pat Keener, group manager for energy services.
?????The first two projects approved by the energy commission under the 
21-day program are Wildflower Energy LP peakers totaling 225 megawatts in 
Palm Springs and San Diego. Project manager John Jones said that they have 
been in development since last year, that construction started a week ago and 
that the plants should be running sometime in July.
?????+If [other developers] have not started [the permitting] already,+ he 
said, +it would be a real challenge to be up by the summer.+

Davis Says All Power Costs to Be Recovered
Crisis: Governor vows that under his plan, billions spent by the state will 
be recouped within months. He admits summer outages are an ominous 
possibility.
By MITCHELL LANDSBERG and MIGUEL BUSTILLO, Times Staff Writers
?????Billions of dollars that have been drained from the state treasury to 
buy electricity so far this year will be fully repaid by June 30, and 
taxpayers will wind up spending +not one penny+ on the energy crisis, an 
optimistic Gov. Gray Davis pledged Friday.
?????+We will not only be paid off for all our expenses to date, we,ll have 
enough . . . to continue buying power through this year and hopefully through 
2002,+ Davis said in an interview with Times editors and reporters.
?????The governor admitted that Californians face an uncertain--and possibly 
treacherous--summer. Already, he said, state officials have begun consulting 
with law enforcement officials around the country to develop a plan for 
dealing with the blackouts that could become a part of daily life during hot 
spells.
?????But he was nevertheless upbeat about the financial package he has 
crafted to rescue the state,s big private utilities. And he was unusually 
salty in his denunciations of those he considers responsible for the power 
shortages and price surges that have wreaked havoc in the state,s newly 
deregulated electricity market.
?????Davis described the out-of-state power generators and marketers who have 
raised the price of electricity by hundreds of percentage points as +the 
biggest snakes on the planet Earth.+
?????He questioned what his predecessors 
in state leadership were thinking when they failed to plan for growth in 
electricity demand. But he saved most of his vituperation for the federal 
agency that has refused the state,s entreaties to place a cap on wholesale 
electricity prices.
?????+If you,re looking for a culprit, I,ll give you a culprit,+ he said. 
+The culprit is the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.+ As far back as 
1995, Davis charged, the commission was undermining California by overruling 
state agencies that were seeking permission to build more power plants.
?????+They,ve consistently turned a deaf ear to my pleas, Sen. [Dianne] 
Feinstein,s pleas, the pleas of the governors and representatives of Oregon 
and Washington,+ he said. +So if there is a villain, it clearly is the 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.+
?????Davis said the state was forging 
ahead on its own to solve the crisis. Through a combination of an 
$850-million conservation plan and what the governor described as the fastest 
power plant construction program in California history, the state hopes to 
keep blackouts to a minimum this summer.
?????Asked what he would tell Californians who will be paying higher rates 
while suffering through outages, Davis said: +Look . . . we live in one of 
the best places on the planet at one of the most fortunate times. Virtually 
nobody alive had to go through the Holocaust, the Depression, any of the 
world wars. . . . In everyone,s life comes a little sun and a little rain. We 
have to just act like adults and work our way through this problem. That,s 
what I,d say.+

?????Blaming Others for the Crisis
?????Davis expressed frustration at the hand he has been dealt, repeatedly 
insisting that he had inherited the power problems, not created them.
?????At the time that deregulation was being considered by the Legislature in 
1996, Davis was state controller. +I basically wasn,t asked to take a 
position and I didn,t take a position,+ he said. +I didn,t give it much 
thought.+
?????Since January, the state has been forced to spend $5.2 billion 
buying power that Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric have 
been unable to afford.
?????A Davis-sponsored plan approved by the Legislature calls for the state 
to float bonds to repay the state and help finance the purchases. The bonds, 
in turn, would be repaid by utility ratepayers through their monthly bills.
?????The plan was based on the premise that the state would be able to 
stabilize, and eventually lower, the price of electricity by entering into 
long-term contracts with power suppliers. Those lower prices have yet to 
materialize.
?????On average, California has been burning through $50 million a day on 
electricity--and that number will soon go up to about $57 million, 
administration officials say, because of a federal regulatory decision last 
week. That decision requires the state to buy power on behalf of cash-poor 
utilities, regardless of price.
?????Despite the mind-numbing figures, Davis and his financial advisors 
insisted Friday that they have created a plan that will make the utilities 
self-supporting--and take taxpayers off the hook--by early 2003. Here,s how:
?????* A record $12.4 billion in bonds scheduled to be issued in June would 
not only repay the budget, but would cover future state purchases of 
electricity and help the utilities repay their debts. ?????* New, higher 
electricity rates would give California about $6 billion this year. That 
money, along with the portion of the bond money left over after repayment of 
the state,s debts, would be used to finance future state power purchases.
?????The rationale behind those estimates is nearly impossible to scrutinize, 
because Davis, cadre of Wall Street advisors and utility experts has refused 
to make public the contract information on which the figures are based.
?????They have even kept the information from state Treasurer Phil 
Angelides--the elected official charged with implementing the bond deal that 
is the linchpin of the recovery plan.
?????In recent weeks, Angelides has made a series of public statements 
raising questions about the plan.
?????At the current rate that California is spending money on electricity, 
Angelides estimated, the bond issue will run out this fall--not, as Davis 
said, in 2002.
?????Davis and his advisors said Friday that Angelides did not understand the 
true status of California,s foray into the power business because the 
administration had not shared its numbers with him. Davis planned to share 
more information with Angelides in coming weeks as the bond deal grew nearer, 
they said. The state will also be required to disclose some information when 
its bonds are offered for sale.
?????Davis insisted Friday that he has crafted +a very well thought-through 
plan,+ adding that it had been given the +Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval+ 
by major Wall Street investment firms.
?????Davis complained that the energy crisis has diverted his attention from 
other pressing matters, and said that, since late December, he has spent a 
total of only 10 working hours dealing with issues other than energy.
?????+I realize I have to deal with it but it,s ridiculous,+ Davis said. +I 
can,t deal with education, the environment, health care, nothing. That,s all 
I do.+
?????In other developments Friday:
?????* A key Davis aide, Communications Director Phil Trounstine, resigned 
his $113,000-a-year job +to spend more time with my family and pursue a 
variety of offers in strategic communications.+
?????Trounstine, a former 
newspaper political writer who has written many of Davis, key speeches, had 
most recently been coordinating the governor,s energy conservation publicity 
campaign. The resignation will take effect at the end of the month.
?????* A state energy panel recommended Friday that AES Corp., a major power 
generator in California, should be forced to sell any electricity it makes 
from two now mothballed generators in Huntington Beach to the state in 
exchange for expedited review of the company,s operating permit.
?????The California Energy Commission,s licensing committee, which is 
overseeing the company,s pursuit of a fast-track permit, had previously 
stopped short of attaching such a condition to the project after being warned 
by commission lawyers that doing so would violate interstate commerce laws.
?????But in a revised decision, the committee found that without a sales 
provision guaranteeing that power will be sold to California, the state would 
be deprived of its ability to effectively respond to the energy crisis.
?????If adopted by the full energy commission, which is scheduled to consider 
AES, permit request Wednesday in Sacramento, the sales requirement would set 
a precedent.

Long, Hot, Costly Days 
With a power-hungry summer nearing, state leaders and other Californians 
aren't doing enough to prepare. And that's risky business. 

?????It's going to be a long, hot, frustrating and expensive summer in 
California. Even a grim recent forecast that the state would endure 34 days 
of rolling blackouts could be optimistic. It could also be a dangerous 
summer. One energy expert says, ""We need to prepare for this as if we're 
preparing for a natural diaster."" But we're not, or not enough, perhaps 
because Gov. Gray Davis seems loath to admit that the state's immediate 
energy future is as bad as it is. 
?????Look at it this way. A megawatt-hour is enough power to serve about 
1,000 average homes for one hour. This August, some of those megawatt-hours 
may cost, wholesale, nearly 20 times what they cost two years ago--an 
increase from $40 in August 1999 to $750 in contracts already made for this 
August. 
?????Peak summer demand in California is 55,000 megawatts or more. The state 
could fall 3,000 to 7,000 megawatts a day short of that, in part because 
drought in the Pacific Northwest will severely curtail hydropower. 
?????Davis says the $850-million conservation program he signed into law last 
week, combined with existing programs, can cut at least 5,000 megawatts from 
peak demand this summer. But at this late date, it will be very difficult to 
get a persuasive statewide program into effect before the hot days arrive. 
?????Higher electricity rates, pending before the Public Utilities 
Commission, and the governor's promise of a 20% rebate for power savings 
should spur some conservation. Again, those actions have yet to be 
implemented and are unlikely to have much effect in time for air conditioning 
season. 
?????Even so, Californians can certainly understand that every kilowatt they 
save is a kilowatt that need not be scrounged at top dollar. Every thousand 
kilowatts add up to a megawatt that won't have to be bought from unscrupulous 
generators selling at villainous prices during the hours of high 
demand--prices that will be demanded even if they cripple the California 
economy that is laying such golden eggs for the sellers. 
?????The biggest power hog is air conditioning, for both homes and 
businesses. Part of the state's conservation program is intended to help 
finance more efficient new systems, but considerable savings can be made 
through just a good inspection and repair and turning up the thermostat a few 
degrees. 
?????When blackouts do come, the state and the utilities should put them on a 
set schedule rather than conducting them at random. This would help eliminate 
some of the uncertainty and panic involved. Cities with municipal power 
systems, including Los Angeles, will avoid blackouts but can help by 
conserving power and continuing to sell the resulting surplus to other parts 
of the state. 
?????Gov. Davis says he expects to have perhaps four new plants up and 
producing by August. He spins a scenario of a tough summer followed by a 
continuous easing as more plants are built, prices come down and the state 
gets out of the power-buying business. He also says the state will be repaid 
every penny it has spent to buy power as Sacramento issues revenue bonds 
funded by the coming electricity price increases. 
?????We can only take Davis at his word. He has not offered an accounting of 
the spending from the state's general fund to buy power, both daily and in 
long-term contracts, or revealed the assumptions that underlie his 
projections. Of course the money for repayment will come from higher rates 
paid by consumers. The public interest in how these billions are spent 
overshadows any fear that companies might find out the details of long-term 
contracts, which Davis cites as the cause for his secrecy. 
?????Even if residents and businesses are wholehearted in their conservation, 
however, and even if the state does everything right to increase supply, 
there's still the obstinate Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which seems 
not to understand the word ""regulatory."" FERC refuses to impose a reasonable, 
cost-based and very temporary price cap on wholesale power sales in the West. 
The main opponent of price caps, FERC Chairman Curtis L. Hebert Jr., says 
caps don't work because ""the energy is going to go where the money is."" That 
sounds just like legendary bank robber Willie Sutton, who said he robbed 
banks because that's where the money is. 
?????Open markets are fine--when they work right. Power is a necessity of 
life. The federal government has an obligation to protect the public health 
and safety. A temporary cap that allowed for a healthy profit would not 
discourage energy companies from investing in new power plants. It would 
certainly prevent Californians from being mugged again and might help the 
state avoid a true calamity.

Passing Along the Cost 
Many Bay Area businesses resort to surcharges to survive 
Matthew Yi, Chronicle Staff Writer
Monday, April 16, 2001 
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle

N52884.DTL 

Just outside the double doors of the Englander Sports Pub & Restaurant in San 
Leandro is a hand-written sign: ""There will be a 5% PG&E surcharge added to 
all food served."" 
It's more than just a sign of the times in these days of energy crisis in 
California. 
As gas and electricity bills skyrocket, many businesses around the Bay Area 
are resorting to adding energy surcharges to stay afloat. Hotels around the 
state already have started asking customers to pay more. Now, even everyday 
consumptions such as dining out and working out at the gym will cost more. 
""It was fun to do business. You go home, sleep at night time, get up the next 
day and say, 'Hey, we're gonna do it all over again,' "" said Englander owner 
Jot Mangat, 46. ""But now, you go home and you're wondering how much my PG&E 
bill is going to be. Where is this money going to come from?"" 
Last year, his power bill was around $3,400 a month. But in February, it 
nearly doubled to $6,000, and that's even before the Public Utilities 
Commission decided to raise rates as much as 40 percent this year. 
Mangat thinks that by this summer, his power bills may eclipse his monthly 
rent, which is $8,000 for his downtown San Leandro establishment. 
""This is one of the nicest restaurants in San Leandro,"" he said. ""San Leandro 
is proud of this place, but PG&E can put us out of business."" 
Mark Cavalli, 34, and Donna Clark, 35, both of Oakland, said they had been 
caught off guard when they noticed the $1 energy surcharge added to their 
dinner bill on Friday at the Englander. 
""I felt I understood it, especially with all those TVs running,"" Clark said. 
""But I didn't like the place enough to come back here again and pay the 
surcharge. If I liked it more, maybe I wouldn't mind paying extra."" 
SLIM MARGINS, HIGH PRICES
Escalating power costs are particularly hard on restaurants because their 
profit margin is already slim, averaging 2 to 7 percent, said John Dunlap, 
president and CEO of the California Restaurant Association, a lobbying group 
in Sacramento. 
""If you're a restaurateur on the brink . . . or if you're not having a good 
year, this could push you over the edge,"" Dunlap said. ""You're going to see 
hundreds of restaurants closing statewide because of this. . . . I can assure 
you, there will be a body count."" 
And that's exactly what Martha Pena, manager at Fentons Creamery & Restaurant 
in Oakland, wants to avoid. 
The popular ice cream parlor started adding energy surcharges to customers' 
bills two months ago: 25 cents per $10 for takeouts and 30 cents per $10 for 
dining in. 
They also posted a sign near the front door to alert customers. 
""Sometimes people ask us why we're doing this, but after we give them the 
explanation, they say they understand,"" Pena said. 
Fentons' ice cream was still as sweet Saturday, even with the 30-cent bump in 
their lunch bill, said John and Theresa Strickland of Pleasanton. 
""Actually we didn't even notice,"" John Strickland said, adding that he was 
willing to pay the little bit extra if it meant keeping a place like Fentons 
in business. 
BUSINESS THREAT
""The energy crisis is going to put smaller places out of business unless they 
add surcharges,"" Theresa Strickland said. ""The little fish can't compete with 
the big sharks."" 
Fentons' gas bill more than doubled from $400 to $1,000 a month since last 
year, while the electricity bill has stayed relatively stable at around $300. 
But that was during the winter season when the business doesn't have to blast 
its air conditioning. The power bill picture will likely look drastically 
different when the weather warms up this spring and summer, said Fentons 
bookkeeper Dan Tonelli. 
Bars and restaurants are not the only businesses to feel the pinch. 
At the Albany Sauna & Hot Tubs, owner Tim Adam has already raised prices 
twice since December. 
""It's really upsetting that we're passing this on (to our customers),"" he 
said. ""People who come in here are just ordinary people who care about their 
health. . . . People are saying they're paying more everywhere. . . . What 
we're frustrated about is that (our) cost of living is going up."" 
For half-hour sessions, Adam raised the price from $9 to $10 last December, 
and then added another $1 starting April 6. 
The increases aren't arbitrary. Adam carefully calculated the figures to make 
sure the extra revenues just cover his PG&E bill, which has tripled. 
Adam already has tried to cut down by installing energy efficient light 
bulbs, shutting down unneeded lights and asking customers to use only one 
towel. 
But the bottom line is that his business needs energy to heat water for hot 
tubs, rocks for the dry sauna, and to run washers and dryers for towels. 
YMCA ADDS $1 SURCHARGE
Across the Bay, the YMCA of San Francisco also has decided to add energy 
surcharges: $1 per month across the board for everyone. 
After six months, the YMCA will reconsider whether to stop, continue or 
increase the surcharges, spokeswoman Jane Holt said. 
At the Central YMCA in the Tenderloin, the gas bill has nearly tripled to 
$23,000 as administrators scramble for ways to save energy, she said. 
""We've put in fluorescent lights. . . . All the boilers and other systems are 
working as efficiently as possible . . . insulated the pipes, added digital 
timers for lights,"" Holt said. 
But that hasn't put a dent in the monthly bill. 
And despite the extra fees that will be collected from the Central YMCA's 3, 
500 members, that will not cover increases in the PG&E bills, forcing the 
group to use reserve funds, Holt said. 
Jerry Englebardt, a runner and Y member from New York who visits San 
Francisco four months a year, said he noticed the increase but wasn't 
bothered because ""the facilities here are so good."" 
""In New York,"" Englebardt said, ""they think people in California are going 
around with candles. It's being played up as if California is going out of 
business. But it's not true."" 
HEALTH CLUBS RAISE FEES
Health clubs that feature heated pools, with their high energy costs, are 
really feeling the pinch. 
Linda Hansen, general manager of Walnut Creek Sports & Fitness Club, said 
adding a $3.50 per month energy surcharge to her members' fees was difficult 
because they had just raised their rates by 7 percent at the end of last 
year. 
""We have one heated pool, and we keep it at 83 degrees,"" Hansen said. ""When 
we had the cold spell, that was killing us. . . . But what else can we do?"" 
""Inside, I'm screaming . . ."" Hansen said. ""I'm angry, really angry that the 
state of California has put the businesses in such a precarious situation."" 
Tell Us What You Think -- Can you save 20 percent on your energy usage? Gov. 
Gray Davis' administration is offering rebates to Californians who save on

Time Seems Bright for Solar Power 
Big companies bring financial clout to field

N28455.DTL 

On the sun-bleached floor of the Mojave Desert, solar-thermal plants are 
producing electricity to fulfill a long-term contract with Southern 
California Edison Co. 
Rows of parabolic mirrors focus the sun's rays into a high-energy beam that 
heats an element to make steam, which turns an electrical turbine. In all, 
nine solar-thermal units near Barstow generate enough daytime power for 350, 
000 homes. 
""This technology has been around for 15 years,"" said Bob Cable, manager of 
KJC Operating Co., which runs five of the solar-thermal units for investors 
that include East Coast utilities and insurance firms. ""It's very reliable. 
And with today's high fuel prices, we're a bargain. 
""There's really nothing like us in the world,"" Cable said. And for renewable 
energy advocates, that's the problem. 
Solar-thermal is just one of several renewable forms of energy that have 
languished for years. No new plants have been built in a decade, mainly 
because power produced using low-cost fossil fuels made alternative energy 
look pricey. 
But now that the price of natural gas has shot up, solar, wind and geothermal 
are more attractive to big energy suppliers. 
""There's a lot of consolidation in the field now. Big players are coming in 
and setting up divisions for solar and wind energy,"" said Dave Renee, a 
research analyst for the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, 
Colo., 
a division of the U.S. Department of Energy. 
Even before the power crisis, oil and gas companies were increasing their 
stake in renewables and buying up smaller energy firms because of rising fuel 
costs and tighter environmental restrictions on fossil fuel plants. 
Sharp, the Japanese electronics company, last year became the world's largest 
producer of photovoltaic solar cells, which convert sunlight directly into 
electricity. At the Sydney Olympics, BP Solar -- a division of British 
Petroleum's energy-producing empire -- powered a solar suburb of 650 homes to 
house the athletes. 
A year ago, Shell Oil created its Shell Renewables division, which formed a 
joint venture with Siemens Solar, another leading manufacturer of solar 
cells. Shell predicts that by 2050 half the U.S. energy mix will be 
renewable. 
Enron, the Texas supplier of natural gas, has bought Zond, a major wind power 
company. The oil companies have also invested in hydrogen fuel cell 
technology, which may soon be used to power cars, homes, offices and 
factories. 
""We think the new technologies are going to get better, and prices will come 
down,"" said George Douglas, a spokesman for the National Renewable Energy 
Laboratory. ""And we think the price of conventional power plants, whatever 
fuel they're using, is going to come up."" 
12 PERCENT RENEWABLE POWER 
Today, only 12 percent of California's power comes from renewables, but 
advocates envision a future electrical grid with a diverse mix of 
nonpolluting energy sources, large and small. 
""California should be much more aggressive in pursuing the renewable energy 
options,"" said Dick Swanson, president of SunPower Corp., a Silicon Valley 
company that has developed new solar technology being used in power plants in 
Australia and Arizona. ""We are leaving the state too vulnerable if we are too 
dependent on natural gas."" 
Gov. Gray Davis wants to rush 5,000 megawatts of capacity into service by 
July through construction of large and small power plants. Renewable energy 
advocates say Californians should carefully consider which kind. 
""The investments we make this year and next year will stay with us for the 
next 30 years,"" said Kari Smith, a regulatory affairs manager for Powerlight, 
which makes photovoltaic systems for factories and office parks. ""We need to 
promote as much renewable energy as possible so that we're not stuck again 
with a fossil fuel economy."" 
Sixteen percent of the new 5,000 megawatts will come from renewables -- 
mainly from wind power, but also from biomass, energy created from organic 
waste. 
The California Energy Commission's $202 million subsidy program for renewable 
plants offers financing incentives of as much as 1.5 cents per kilowatt hour, 
or up to one quarter of cost, to help these systems compete. 
ECONOMIC INCENTIVES
Environmentalists want more economic incentives for renewables, and also 
taxes on fossil fuel power plants to offset the pollution they cause. 
Since the 1970s, most government subsidies for renewable technologies have 
gone to solar power, although it accounts for less than 1 percent of the 
state's electricity -- less than geothermal (5 percent), wind (2 percent), 
small hydro plants (3 percent) and biomass (2 percent). 
Solar has proved costly to develop, but appears to be on the verge of paying 
off. 
""In the last 20 years the cost of producing electricity from solar cells has 
dropped tenfold,"" Douglas said. ""We can expect it to drop at a similar rate 
over the next 20 years by raising efficiencies of solar cells and decreasing 
the manufacturing costs."" 
The U.S. market for solar energy has grown steadily in recent years, but more 
than 70 percent of photovoltaic systems are exported to developing countries. 
Solar panels, used since the late 1950s on orbiting satellites, are only now 
becoming affordable. A household unit can cost $10,000 to $30,000, though in 
California, state rebates can reduce the cost by half. 
In December, the state Energy Commission received 50 applications from homes 
and businesses for its ""buy down"" program, which offers rebates of up to 50 
percent for the cost of solar panels and small wind generators. In January, 
there were 250. In February, there were 245. 
WAIT LIST FOR HOME SYSTEMS
In Sacramento, the local utility district sells solar panels to residential 
customers at reduced rates. The utility, which also installs the panels, has 
a waiting list of 700 homeowners for a total of 100 solar units available 
this year. 
""We foresee the day in the next five or 10 years when photovoltaics will 
compete with fossil fuel-generated power price-wise without subsidies,"" said 
Vince Schwent, who runs the Sacramento Municipal Utility District's solar 
energy program. ""At that point, the market for solar will explode. Mass 
production will lead to lower prices."" 
Independents that have tried to break into California's power market, 
however, have had difficulty obtaining investors and loans for unconventional 
technologies. 
""The investment market and engineers have been focused on the creation of 
large power plants,"" said Richard Harkrader, a North Carolina energy 
consultant. ""How do you persuade people to make the higher investment in 
return for no emissions and (ending the uncertainty of) fuel costs?"" 
But solar research scientist Jim Augustyn, a contractor for the U.S. 
Department of Energy, cautions against the federal or state governments 
pushing too hard for alternative energy systems. 
""The government could do more, but they have to be careful about how they do 
it,"" Augustyn said. ""You can't just throw a lot of money at the technology 
and expect it to grow fast. You have to build this whole infrastructure. 
There are people who can install a photovoltaic system on your roof, but 
there are not a lot of them."" 
Scientists disagree on how much fossil fuel the Earth holds. But few think 
this year's energy crisis will be the last. 
""I think that we should view this century as a transition away from fossil 
fuels,"" SunPower's Swanson said. ""If we wait too long, it's just going to be 
that much more painful."" 
Energy Economics With tax credits and rebates, wind power is already 
competitive in price with conventional energy sources, and solar power is 
fast becoming more affordable. . The cost of building a natural gas boiler 
runs about $1 million per megawatt of capacity. Wind generators cost about 
the same to build. Solar thermal units cost more than twice as much. But the 
fluctuating price of fuel must be factored into the cost of making 
electricity from natural gas.

946EDT0145.DTL&type=news 
, , -- (04-16) 06:57 PDT Here is a look at developments in California's 
energy crisis: 
MONDAY:< ?-- The state is under no power alerts as reserves stay above 7 percent. ?-- Gov. Gray Davis is expected to meet with legislative leaders over a plan ?to buy Southern California Edison's transmission lines. ?-- Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric Co. are scheduled to begin paying ?hundreds of smaller generators for future deliveries, under a plan by the ?Public Utilities Commission. ?SUNDAY:< 
-- PG&E officials demanded the utility be cut free from state regulation and 
be allowed to push huge rate increases onto its customers, two weeks before 
negotiations with Davis broke off, the San Francisco Chronicle reported. 
-- State energy officials are pushing for approval of a power plant in San 
Jose's Coyote Valley, despite recommendations that other sites may be more 
environmentally suitable, the San Jose Mercury News reported. 
The deputy director of the California Energy Commission, Bob Therkelsen, 
denied any impartial dealings concerning the plant. 
FRIDAY:< ?-- Davis asks state lawmakers to approve spending $500 million more to buy ?power for two struggling utilities, bringing his total requests to $5.2 ?billion. ?-- The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission orders generators who have sold ?electricity to the state to share power purchase information with the federal ?agency, which will then supply the information to a House subcommittee that ?held three days of hearings this week on California's energy problems. ?-- A business group, the California Alliance for Energy and Economic ?Stability, says a proposed restructuring of the state's electric rate ?structure by the PUC would hurt the state's economy by putting a greater rate ?burden on businesses. ?-- Edison is granted a stay in a federal lawsuit it brought against the PUC ?seeking to raise rates. Edison says both sides agreed to stop discovery and ?postpone hearings on all motions while the state considers an agreement ?brokered by Davis last week. Either side can request that the stay be lifted ?with five days notice. ?-- A Superior Court judge in Los Angeles agrees to consider whether the dozen ?or so cases filed against Edison by small power generators should be ?consolidated into one case. The companies say they have not been paid for ?power delivered to the utility since November. ?-- Edison says it has sent $206 million in payments to all small power ?generators that have provided the utility with estimates of their April ?bills. Under a PUC plan, Edison and PG&E were required to pay the so-called ?``qualifying facilities'' by Monday. ?-- The state is under no power alerts as reserves stay above 7 percent. ?WHAT'S NEXT:< 
-- Davis will lobby legislative leaders on Monday, Senate Republicans and 
Assembly Democrats Tuesday, and Senate Democrats Wednesday to support his 
agreement to purchase Southern California Edison's power transmission lines 
as a way of helping the company pay off its debt. The governor wants to buy 
the power lines for $2.76 billion, but lawmakers of both parties have 
challenged the plan. 
-- An Imperial County judge could rule Monday whether Edison must pay 
CalEnergy, a geothermal power producer, $140 million in past payments. 
CalEnergy has already been granted the right to break its contract with 
Edison and sell power on the open market. 
-- Edison and PG&E are expected to file their 2000 earnings reports April 17. 
-- The state Senate starts hearings April 18 in its inquiry into allegations 
that electricity suppliers illegally withheld power to drive up California's 
wholesale prices. Wholesalers deny such accusations. 
-- Also April 18, the Assembly plans to resume hearings in its inquiry into 
California's highest-in-the-nation natural gas prices. 
THE PROBLEM:< ?High demand, high wholesale energy costs, transmission glitches and a tight ?supply worsened by scarce hydroelectric power in the Northwest and ?maintenance at aging California power plants are all factors in California's ?electricity crisis. ?Edison and PG&E say they've lost nearly $14 billion since June to high ?wholesale prices that the state's electricity deregulation law bars them from ?passing on to consumers. PG&E, saying it hasn't received the help it needs ?from regulators or state lawmakers, filed for federal bankruptcy protection ?April 6. ?Electricity and natural gas suppliers, scared off by the two companies' poor ?credit ratings, are refusing to sell to them, leading the state in January to ?start buying power for the utilities' nearly 9 million residential and ?business customers. The state is also buying power for a third investor-owned ?utility, San Diego Gas & Electric, which is in better financial shape than ?much larger Edison and PG&E but also struggling with high wholesale power ?costs. ?The Public Utilities Commission has raised rates up to 46 percent to help ?finance the state's multibillion-dollar power-buying. ?Even before those increases, California residents paid some of the highest ?prices in the nation for electricity. Federal statistics from October show ?residential customers in California paid an average of 10.7 cents per ?kilowatt hour, or 26 percent more than the nationwide average of 8.5 cents. ?Only customers in New England, New York, Alaska and Hawaii paid more. ?,2001 Associated Press ? ?------------------------------------------------------------------------------?---------------------------------------------------------------?Plan to Save Edison Faces Skepticism in Sacramento ?No legislative clamor for Davis' bailout deal ?Greg Lucas, Sacramento Bureau Chief?Monday, April 16, 2001 ?,2001 San Francisco Chronicle ?URL: ?http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/04/16/M?N138633.DTL&type=news ?Sacramento -- Gov. Gray Davis may have a hard time persuading skeptical ?lawmakers to approve the deal he reached last week to rescue Southern ?California Edison. ?It's a sell job with the highest stakes. Without legislative approval, the ?deal collapses, and Edison probably joins Pacific Gas and Electric Co. in ?bankruptcy court. ?""I don't feel there is a gun to my head to pass this deal with Edison. This ?is going to be pounded like a cheap steak,"" said Sen. Don Perata, D-Oakland. ?""It's the governor who is going to have to come in and sell it to us,"" Perata ?said. ""I don't intend to deal with intermediaries."" ?That's the central tension as lawmakers return today from a one-week spring ?break. ?There is also a mountain of bills on other issues that have languished for ?months while the Legislature wrestled with the state's energy mess. ?But it is Davis' $2.7 billion dollar deal -- and its bankrolling of a hefty ?chunk of Edison's financial recovery with ratepayer dollars -- that could ?elevate some Democrats' private grumblings about the governor into open ?rebellion. ?WHOLESALE APPROVAL SOUGHT?Magnifying that legislative grumpiness, Davis wants lawmakers to rubber- ?stamp his deal. ?""The governor would prefer if they took the negotiation lock, stock and ?barrel but they have the right to amend it as needed,"" said Steve Maviglio, ?Davis' press secretary. ""We don't want them to, but they can."" ?In an April 10 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Edison ?suggests that if the Legislature changes the deal or balks at voting for it, ?all bets are off. ?""They can have it that way, as long as they're comfortable with the answer ?not being yes,"" said state Sen. Debra Bowen, D-Marina del Rey, chairwoman of ?the upper house's energy committee. ""Last time I checked, the Senate don't ?cotton much to ultimatums."" ?Bowen, who will lead the Senate's review of the deal, opposes it. ?""I don't understand why this is a good deal for ratepayers. It looks like a ?deal for Edison shareholders and the creditors,"" she said. ""And I don't ?understand what the rush is, because it does nothing to help us this summer."" ?UTILITY CAN WALK AWAY?The deal itself says that if legislative approval is not given by Aug. 15, ?Edison can walk away. ?Maviglio said Davis plans to be in Sacramento this week to meet with ?lawmakers and pitch his deal. But he did not know when Davis would present ?proposed legislation. ?Frustrated by the governor's past refusal to present a comprehensive package ?of bills to address the energy crisis, lawmakers have said they won't do ?anything about the Edison deal until Davis gives them a bill to introduce. ?There are already signs that Davis' proposal is anything but a legislative ?slam dunk. ?Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco, said last week that ?the plan needs to be subjected to ""extensive"" legislative hearings by the ?Senate energy and appropriations committees and possibly the judiciary ?committees. ?Extensive hearings is often legislative code for death by 1,000 cuts. ?Lawmakers have also questioned the cost of buying Edison's transmission ?lines. More lawmakers are also wondering what benefit the state gets from ?owning a portion of the grid instead of all of it. ?Before PG&E's bankruptcy, much of the Legislature's and governor's actions ?were driven by a desire to prevent bankruptcies for fear it would cut ?consumers off from power. ?But more than a week after PG&E filed for bankruptcy, the lights are still on ?and, increasingly, lawmakers are saying that perhaps a bankruptcy court is a ?better venue than the political process to sort out the problems of PG&E and ?Edison. ?""There is a re-evaluation happening,"" said Assemblywoman Helen Thomson, D- ?Davis. ?NOT A REGIONAL PRIORITY?Thomson also said bailing out Edison is not a top-of-the-list priority for ?Northern California lawmakers. ?""What are those Southern California power lines going to connect up to? How's ?this deal going to benefit electricity in the north?"" Thomson said. ""You can ?buy a lot of health care, school books and traffic relief for $2.7 billion. "" ?The state has already spent about $5.2 billion to buy electricity on behalf ?of California's two largest investor-owned utilities. ?Democrats also can vote against the Edison deal with the blessing of consumer ?groups that brand Davis' deal a gargantuan giveaway to Edison, with the ?bailout coming mainly at the expense of ratepayers. ?""It's dead on arrival. It's a complete capitulation to Edison that will cost ?ratepayers billions of dollars,"" said Harvey Rosenfield, head of the ?Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. ?""If the governor says the Legislature stopped me from forcing you, the ?ratepayer, to bail out Edison I don't think legislators have much to fear ?from that criticism,"" Rosenfield said. ?Besides the price, there are many other aspects of the deal to which ?Democrats may object. According to an analysis by legislative staff members: ?""It will take a while to elevate the comfort level,"" said Assemblyman Herb ?Wesson, D-Los Angeles. ?E-mail Greg Lucas at glucas@sfchronicle.com. ?,2001 San Francisco Chronicle ?

So far, it ?has. ?While Bush, a Texas oil veteran, campaigned on reversing the Clinton ?administration's energy ""neglect,"" California's crisis made energy an ?unwelcome early priority, consuming vast quantities of White House attention ?during Bush's critical first months in office. ?Bush tapped Vice President Dick Cheney, another oil veteran, to head a ?Cabinet-level task force to plot out a plan. While California posed risks, ?the administration calculated that the state could also serve as a poster ?child for what happens when energy needs are ignored. ?But so far, a proposal to drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge has ?become the poster child. ?As the plan's outlines take shape, there is more that will send ?environmentalists to the barricades: more use of coal, more nuclear power, ?more drilling for oil and gas on public lands, more power lines and ?pipelines, and easier licensing of hydroelectric dams. ?""We're looking at all different approaches to it and want to present a ?balanced approach,"" Interior Secretary Gale Norton said Thursday. ?DEFENDING A POSITION?Top Bush officials are playing defense, listing ways they are helping ?California and explaining why their strategy does not include price controls. ?Yet as California's crisis spreads across the West, so does the call for ?price controls, even as support for more production fails to build. ?""Unfortunately the national focus . . . has been diverted away from the ?challenge of inadequate supply to price controls,"" said Energy Secretary ?Spencer Abraham recently. ?Meanwhile, high energy prices are undermining the economy. Indeed, the reason ?the White House so resists price caps is its conviction that caps would make ?the shortages -- and the economic damage -- worse. ?Bush's answer is to boost supply. But the combination makes for dangerous ?politics: an energy policy that is portrayed as both anti-environment and ?anti- California. ?Fred C. Smith, head of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, one of many ?conservative policy groups closely allied with the administration, thinks the ?public will come Bush's way. ?""When they're faced with a choice between no air conditioning and no lights ?and no jobs, or drilling in areas they have never been to . . . they're going ?to be crying for getting energy out there,"" he said. ?GAS-RICH FORMATION?Although drilling in the Arctic Refuge has drawn the most heat -- and is ?already losing Republican votes in the Senate -- Bush may focus more on the ?Overthrust Belt, a geological formation in the Rockies considered potentially ?rich in natural gas. ?President Bill Clinton blocked large portions of the area to drilling when he ?put roadless designations on 58 million acres during his last days in office. ?A Bush reversal of Clinton's move is ""virtually guaranteed,"" said Robert ?Nelson, a University of Maryland professor close to the administration. ""The ?Overthrust Belt is one of the major prospective gas areas in the country."" ?Studies estimate it might hold 137 trillion cubic feet of gas, enough to meet ?all current U.S. needs for nearly seven years. But 40 percent of that is on ?federal land that is closed to drilling. ?A draft Interior Department report indicates a broad-ranging review of all ?such land policies. The administration might even look at Clinton's new ?national monuments designations, such as the Carrizo Plain between ?Bakersfield and Santa Maria that is thought to have gas potential. ?The administration says 90 new power plants must be built each year to keep ?up with demand, and it sees nuclear power, which now provides 20 percent of ?the nation's electricity, as an alternative to over-reliance on the natural- ?gas generators. ?Cheney also advocates nuclear power -- which does not produce the carbon ?dioxide emissions many scientists believe cause global warming -- as a ?response to the barrage of criticism for the administration's exit from the ?Kyoto Protocol, which calls for large cuts in carbon dioxide emissions. ?The United States has not built a nuclear plant since the Three Mile Island ?accident a generation ago. But proponents contend that new plants are ?smaller, safer and cheaper and can be built in months, not years, although ?Cheney concedes that the problem of waste disposal is unsolved. ?Although many environmentalists cut their teeth on the anti-nuclear movement, ?up to now they have not actively opposed nuclear power plant relicensing. ?Whether they will accept new construction is another matter. ?At the same time, the administration is planning a big push for coal -- which ?does produce large amounts of carbon dioxide and other emissions. Coal- fired ?generators, which produce 52 percent of the nation's electricity, are ?increasingly being supplanted by cleaner natural gas plants. Bush's budget ?calls for a new $150 billion ""clean coal power initiative,"" and Abraham ?emphasized that the United States has a 250-year supply of coal at current ?use levels. ?CONSERVATION LACKING?But even environmental groups that resisted criticizing Bush when he took ?office now blast him for rejecting conservation as an alternative. ?""Leading people to believe that America can drill its way out of its energy ?dependence is just silly,"" said Philip Kavits, spokesman for the National ?Wildlife Federation. ?Lynn Scarlett, president of the libertarian Reason Foundation and nominated ?by Bush to a top Interior Department post, maintains that U.S. environmental ?standards and technology argue for meeting more energy needs here. ?""If anyone in the world is going to do it in an environmentally sensitive ?way, it's going to be the United States,"" she said. ""Not Russia, not Iraq, ?not China."" ?Scarlett also said the administration ""has every intention"" of using ?alternative fuels, especially biomass. ?Bush and his top officials have warned from the outset that the new energy ?policy will offer few direct remedies for California. ?""Those who wish for overnight solutions I think are not going to find us able ?to solve every problem in a matter of days,"" Abraham said. ?Indeed, Bush himself has said that California's electricity meltdown is a ?problem that California has to fix, and that his energy policy will be aimed ?more broadly. ?When the policy emerges, however, it may only heap fuel on the fight with ?environmentalists, and face criticism for doing little to aid California. ?E-mail Carolyn Lochhead at clochhead@sfchronicle.com. ?,2001 San Francisco Chronicle ?

As the patrons arrived, they were ?kept outside the hall -- the San Francisco Symphony kindly provided chairs ?for ticket holders, if not the performers.

Others are ?swallowing the increases but may have to boost prices if power costs keep ?rising. The bigger venues are preparing for rolling blackouts. ?""We are exploring the possibility of surcharges for areas that are costing us ?more to operate, specifically higher utility costs,"" said Neal Pinkser, ?executive vice president of theater operations for United Artists Theater ?Circuit Inc., which owns 25 movie theaters in California. ?Concert promoter Bill Graham Presents has been hit by skyrocketing power ?costs, but is concerned also about public safety. ?""If a rolling blackout comes and you have 25,000 people in your venue, you ?might have a safety issue,"" said Sherry Wasserman, a Bill Graham senior vice ?president. That's why the company is getting those monster generators. ?""The power necessary to continue running your standard rock show -- the ?lights, the sound -- is enormous,"" Wasserman said. ?BGP is not raising prices. But, ""If utility prices continue to rise, it would ?be naive to think that the cost wouldn't be passed on to the consumer, one ?way or another."" ?The big nonprofit groups have no immediate plans to raise ticket prices. But ?they're doing what they can to conserve. ?The staff at Walnut Creek's Dean Lesher Regional Center for the Arts has shut ?off decorative lights around the building and on the trees. Stage lights no ?longer stay on after lighting checks. ?In San Francisco, American Conservatory Theatre, whose $8,373 January PG&E ?bill was 50 percent higher than last year, has dimmed the lobby lights at the ?Geary Theater and is using the air cooling system more judiciously. ?The War Memorial Performing Arts Center, which manages the city-owned Davies ?Hall, Opera House and Veterans Building, has switched off or toned down ?lights throughout the buildings. The Opera House columns, once illuminated ?nightly, are only lit up on performance nights by bulbs whose wattage has ?been reduced from 500 to 300. The 1,000 or so lights in the Davies lobby have ?been dimmed by 15 percent. ?The War Memorial gets its electricity from the city's Hetch-Hetchy project ?but has been hit with whopping increases on its gas bill. It expects to be ?able to pay its power bills this year, but ""I am concerned about the budget ?implications if energy prices should continue to go up,"" said War Memorial ?Managing Director Beth Murray. ""If they do, and we cannot accommodate it ?within our revenue capability, we would have to consider increasing rental ?rates."" ?The San Francisco Ballet, which performs at the Opera House, worries more ?about rolling blackouts than rent hikes. ?""We're much more concerned about the impact on performances should the power ?go out at the Opera House,"" said Ballet General Manager Glenn McCoy. ""We ?can't avoid it, but we've planned for the evacuation of audiences and ?employees. There are lots of flashlights around."" ?The power at the Opera House comes from several substations so the entire ?building wouldn't go dark during a blackout, but the stage lights, rigging ?and some auditorium lights would shut down. An emergency generator would ?power the exit signs. ?Like everyone else, movie theaters are conserving energy by turning off ?lights whenever possible. But you can't flip off the 4,000-watt projector ?bulbs. And with summer coming, the high cost of air-conditioning is bound to ?put a chill on profits. ?""It's going to be a nightmare this summer because of the added costs,"" said ?Alan Michaan, owner of the Renaissance Rialto chain, which owns the four- ?screen Grand Lake Theatre in Oakland and three other East Bay movie houses. ?Michaan, who hoped not to have to raise prices, is paying $5,000 more a month ?for power than he did a year ago. His February PG&E bills totaled $16, 048. ?""It's taking a significant chunk out of our profit,"" he said. He won't cut ?down on the air-conditioning this summer, but he has turned off chandeliers ?and reduced the hours the marquee is on. ?Smaller facilities are being squeezed, too. San Francisco's The Marsh has ?goosed up prices to pay for power. The small nonprofit group, which presents ?plays and performance art, has bumped its Monday night ticket up a buck and ?its weekend comedy shows from $5 to $7. ?At the Paddock Bowl in Pacheco, prices are going up to pay for power. The ?$1-a-game Monday night special just went up 50 cents. The regular $2.50 rate ?will soon be $3.50. ?""My gas bills have gone up over 300 percent in the last few months,"" said ?manager Mark Willard, who was expecting a big jump in his electricity bill. ?During the summer, the alley runs the air-conditioning 16 hours a day.

Gray Davis fell apart after the utility ?demanded unprecedented freedom from regulatory oversight and the ability to ?pass along huge rate increases to consumers, The Chronicle has learned. ?Pacific Gas and Electric Co. claimed that its decision this month to file for ?bankruptcy protection in San Francisco resulted from the governor's ?unwillingness to negotiate a fair deal. ?But a confidential proposal submitted by PG&E during the talks shows that the ?utility was the more ambitious and stubborn negotiator and that the deal ?sought by the company was doomed to fail from the outset. ?""It's like the Japanese insisting that we surrender Hawaii after we beat them ?in World War II,"" said Harvey Rosenfield, head of the Foundation for Taxpayer ?and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica. ?He described PG&E's demands as ""breathtaking in their level of self- ?delusion."" ?A copy of the eight-page, single-spaced proposal was obtained by The ?Chronicle. ?""PG&E was arrogant and defiant, and acted like we owed them something,"" said ?Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for the governor. ""That's not how you enter into ?a negotiation."" ?UTILITY MAKES DEMANDS?Among the utility's demands: ?-- PG&E insisted that it be cleared of any wrongdoing when it transferred ?millions of dollars to its parent company. ?-- In a sale of its power grid to the state, PG&E still wanted to retain ?possession of valuable assets, including the right to profit from any ?telecommunications lines or antennas linked to the system. ?-- PG&E required that it be given first right of refusal if the state ever ?chose to sell off the power lines, allowing the utility to buy back the ?system without competitive offers. ?""It is ludicrous to suggest that this document caused the negotiations to ?break down,"" said Ron Low, a PG&E spokesman. ""There were negotiations that ?occurred later and other documents that followed."" ?The company's proposal is dated Feb. 28. Sources familiar with the ?negotiations said PG&E did not significantly depart from its initial offer ?during follow-up meetings. ?Robert Glynn, chairman of the utility's parent company, PG&E Corp., said that ?when the bankruptcy filing was made April 6, no substantive talks had been ?held for at least three weeks. ?This would have made PG&E's proposal only about two weeks old when the ?negotiations unraveled. ?AT AN IMPASSE?Sources said the utility refused to budge during that interval and that the ?impasse centered primarily on PG&E's insistence that it be subject to less ?oversight by the California Public Utilities Commission. ?""They took a position on regulatory matters that was out of touch with ?reality,"" said Maviglio, the governor's spokesman. ?Indeed, the single most striking aspect of PG&E's proposal is its repeated ?references to a reduction in the state PUC's regulatory authority. ?For example, the utility argues that it is entitled to recoup from consumers ?about $9 billion in costs accrued because of runaway wholesale power prices. ?The proposal says this money ""will be fully recovered in retail rates without ?further CPUC review for prudence or any other purpose."" ?PG&E also insisted that virtually all official restrictions on its activities ?based on the 1996 legislation that deregulated California's electricity ?market be overturned. ?""The CPUC will terminate or modify the scope of existing commission ?proceedings and will not initiate new proceedings related to implementation ?of (the legislation) or issues pertaining to the reasonableness and recovery ?of costs,"" the proposal stipulates. ?This would include a current investigation by the state PUC into whether PG&E ?violated state law by transferring millions of dollars from the utility to ?its parent company before filing for bankruptcy. ?PG&E's proposal maintains that the state ""will waive and release all claims ?arising out of the dispute,"" including the money transfer and a restructuring ?of the parent company that protected it from the utility's financial woes. ?Furthermore, it instructs that the state PUC ""will issue an order finding ?that PG&E and PG&E Corp. have fully complied with state laws and CPUC orders ?. . . and that their conduct and transactions did not contravene public ?policy."" ?""It's Bob Glynn thinking he's god of the universe,"" said Nettie Hoge, ?executive director The Utility Reform Network in San Francisco. ""PG&E doesn't ?think they're beholden to state law. They think they're a law unto ?themselves."" ?Shawn Cooper, a spokesman for PG&E's parent company, declined to discuss the ?contents of the proposal. ""That document is confidential,"" he said. ?THE EDISON DEAL?No language concerning compliance with state laws was included in the accord ?reached last week between the governor and Southern California Edison. ?That agreement, which still requires final approval from lawmakers, would ?restore the utility to creditworthiness in return for acquisition of its ?power lines and other concessions. ?Sources said the deal reached with Edison is ""very close"" to terms offered by ?the state to PG&E. ?Yet, while PG&E's proposal seeks to diminish the regulatory role of the PUC, ?the Edison accord bends over backward to stress the PUC's authority over the ?utility. ?""It is expressly understood that there is no intention to change (Edison) ?continuing to be a public utility that is subject to the jurisdiction of the ?California Public Utilities Commission,"" it states on the first page. ?Maviglio said he did not sit in on the talks with either utility, but he ?learned from negotiators that both PG&E and Edison had misgivings about the ?PUC's role as a consumer watchdog. ?""Edison had some mistrust of the PUC, but they understood that they had to ?live with the regulators,"" he said. ?PG&E, on the other hand, harbored a deeper grudge, which Maviglio said was ?""very emotional"" for the utility. He speculated that PG&E desired retribution ?for a past regulatory setback. ?""Perhaps we misjudged their primary concern,"" he said. ""It wasn't resolving ?their credit issue. It was extracting vengeance on the PUC."" ?TALKS GROUND TO HALT?Maviglio said the talks quickly hit a brick wall after PG&E submitted its ?deal terms. While state negotiators were prepared to discuss many of the ?points, he said, they could not yield on matters of regulatory oversight. ?""We were willing to negotiate the terms of the deal but not constitutional ?controls,"" Maviglio said. ""They were attempting not just to set the course of ?the future but also to right the wrongs of the past."" ?The first sign of trouble emerged when PG&E officials told The Chronicle in ?late March that it appeared the negotiations had collapsed. The governor's ?office, perhaps optimistically, maintained that all was well. ?Around this time, however, PG&E's Glynn made the fateful decision to abandon ?the talks and to instead file for bankruptcy protection. The company gave no ?indication of its move to the governor. ?April 5 would prove to be a pivotal date in California's energy saga. ?While PG&E was preparing to file for bankruptcy the next morning and was ?handing out last-minute bonuses and raises to thousands of employees, Davis ?was putting the final touches on a televised speech in which he would all but ?assure the utilities they would recover their costs through rate increases. ?Sources said the governor's negotiators called PG&E to brief the company's ?chief financial officer, Peter Darbee, on what Davis was about to say. ?They had to pull Darbee from a meeting of PG&E's board of directors, where, ?presumably, the official vote was being taken to file for Chapter 11. Darbee ?was informed about the intended speech but said little in response. ?The next day, after making the bombshell bankruptcy announcement, PG&E's ?Glynn laid blame for the collapse of bailout talks entirely on Davis. ?""We listened carefully to the (governor's) statement and the commentary that ?followed, and this decision is the result,"" he said. ?""The negotiations we have been involved in since last November have gone ?nowhere,"" Glynn added. ""Over the last month, the kindest thing to say is ?progress has dramatically slowed."" ?""There was no room for negotiation,"" countered Maviglio. ""It was their way or ?the highway."" ?Rosenfield of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights seldom sees eye ?to eye with the governor. But in this case, he finds himself defending Davis. ?""The document absolves the governor of responsibility for PG&E's bankruptcy, ?"" Rosenfield said. ""It's good to know there are limits beyond which even ?Davis wouldn't go."" ?The governor's negotiators remain hopeful that a deal still can be reached ?with PG&E comparable to the state's accord with Edison. ?Maviglio said PG&E has several months in which to file a Chapter 11 ?reorganization plan. He said state officials are prepared to work with PG&E ?to produce a plan that meets both sides' goals. ?""It would be the smart thing for them to do,"" Maviglio noted. ""When they come ?out of bankruptcy, they'll still be subject to regulation."" ?E-mail David Lazarus at dlazarus@sfchronicle.com. ?,2001 San Francisco Chronicle ?

The Bush administration's plan is likely ?to face legal and congressional challenges, opponents predicted. ?The Bush administration said the rule it will propose, requiring a 20 percent ?increase in energy efficiency over the current standard, would produce major ?energy savings and air quality gains. Over the next 30 years, it would ?eliminate the need for 27 new electric power plants, officials said. ?The Clinton standard, mandating a 30 percent gain, would have offset the need ?for 39 plants of the same size, officials said. The difference in energy ?savings between the two standards over 30 years equals the annual electricity ?use by all American households today, Energy Department officials said. Both ?rules would take effect in 2006. ?Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham called the new rule a ""realistic"" and ?affordable standard. ""We were particularly concerned that the Clinton rule ?placed too high a cost burden on consumers,"" he said. ?Conservation groups said the administration bowed to industry pressure. ?""California will now have to build an additional two power plants to make up ?for what President Bush did today,"" said Philip Clapp, president of the ?National Environmental Trust. ?""They're working very hard to make the nation more energy-inefficient,"" said ?David Nemtzow, president of the Alliance to Save Energy. ?Earlier in the week, the Energy Department approved a Clinton administration ?energy-saving rule for clothes washers and water heaters. ?The air conditioner rule, which divided manufacturers, was based on disputed ?calculations of how much new units would cost to make and how affordable ?consumers would find them. ?Energy Department officials concluded that new units meeting the 20 percent ?energy-saving standard would add $213 to the average models priced at $2,000 ?and more today, while the Clinton administration standard would cost $335 ?more. ?Proponents of the higher standard said that is a trivial cost difference ?spread over the nearly 20-year life of new air conditioning and heat pump ?units. ?Efficiency Requirements for Future Appliances Rules approved by the Bush ?administration this week will have these effects on future models: ?CLOTHES WASHERS?-- Energy usage cut: 35 percent ?-- Price increase: $249 per unit ?-- Utility bill savings: $48 per year ?WATER HEATERS?-- Energy usage cut: 5 to 9 percent ?-- Price increase: up to $100 per unit ?-- Utility bill savings: up to $182 per year ?AIR CONDITIONERS?-- Energy usage cut: 20 percent ?-- Price increase: $213 per unit ?-- Utility bill savings: $21 per year ?HEAT PUMPS?-- Energy usage cut: 20 percent ?-- Price increase: $144 per unit ?-- Utility bill savings: N/A ?Source: Chronicle News Services ?The Associated Press contributed to this story. ?,2001 San Francisco Chronicle ?

Macro ?Some firms crushed by energy crisis ?Sam Zuckerman, Chronicle Economics Writer?Sunday, April 15, 2001 ?,2001 San Francisco Chronicle ?URL: ?http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/04/15/B?U152654.DTL&type=news ?When Bernard Marszalek talks about economists who say California's energy ?crisis is no big deal, you can almost see the smoke rising from his ears. ?Marszalek, marketing manager for Inkworks Press, a Berkeley printer, has seen ?his company's cost of natural gas go up about 60 percent. Now he's facing the ?prospect of a 40 percent increase in the cost of electricity, which powers ?Inkworks' two presses. The potential hit: $3,600 a year, no small sum for a ?business that grosses $2 million annually. ?""Economists are people in their ivory towers, looking at figures,"" said ?Marszalek. ""You talk to individual businesses and they're hurting."" ?One of the most striking paradoxes of the power crisis has been the vast gulf ?between the cries of pain of California's business community and the bland ?reassurances coming from the economics profession. ?Businesspeople say rising costs and power disruptions have them on the ropes. ?""We are absolutely getting hammered,"" said Mike Betts, co-owner of Betts ?Spring Co., a San Leandro manufacturer of industrial springs. But economists ?insist that overall damage to business in the state will be relatively ?slight. ?So, what gives? Are businesspeople overreacting, or are economists out of ?touch with reality? ?In their own separate ways, it seems, they may both be right. What's going on ?here is a classic illustration of the difference between macro and micro, the ?big picture and the individual portrait. ?""In a large macroeconomy, labor and other costs are more important than ?energy,"" said Mary Daly, an economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of San ?Francisco. ""Our economy is going to be affected (by the power crisis), but it ?is not as large as it might sound when you talk with a manufacturer who uses ?a lot of electricity."" ?Daly pointed to the Asian financial crisis of 1997 and 1998, which ended up ?doing little harm to the U.S. economy as a whole but walloped some sectors of ?U.S. business. ""Apple growers in Washington were devastated"" when Japan and ?other Asian countries cut back fruit imports, she noted. ?Ross DeVol, director of regional studies at the Milken Institute in Santa ?Monica, estimates that the energy crunch will cut the state's economic growth ?rate between 0.25 and 0.4 percentage points during the next five years, a ?relatively small amount. ?The limited economic damage reflects the fact that California has a higher ?proportion of white-collar businesses than most states, and they tend to be ?low energy consumers. ""If you're an advertising agency, you probably won't ?care much about about energy costs,"" DeVol said. ?In California, which produces $1.25 trillion in goods and services annually, ?businesses that are big gas and electricity users -- manufacturers, dairy ?farmers, restaurants and the like -- may not dominate. But there are tens of ?thousands of them, and they say it's scant comfort to think of the big ?picture when they're fighting for survival. ?""We're focused on small- and mid-size manufacturers,"" said Leila Mozaffari, ?vice president of the California Manufacturing Technology Center, a nonprofit ?consulting firm in Los Angeles. ""What we see on a micro level is that the ?energy crisis is hurting them in a bad way. The smaller companies -- their ?backs are against the wall."" ?Take Foote Axle & Forge in Los Angeles. The company, which uses large amounts ?of energy to forge auto parts, has seen its monthly gas bill go from $8,000 ?to $23,000. That prompted owner Mike Denton to shut down his second shift ?earlier this month and fire six workers. Now he's reselling axles made in ?Asia in place of axles made in his own factory. ?""I had to let everybody (on the shift) go. I couldn't afford to run it ?anymore,"" he said. ""It's now cheaper for me to buy products this company has ?been making since 1936. If things don't change, this will become a ?warehouse."" ?Higher gas and electricity prices are hitting at the same time that big jumps ?in health insurance and workers' compensation premiums are taking hold, noted ?Betts. ""We've had four strikes against us this year,"" he said. ?Contrast those stories with the conclusion of a recent report from the ?University of California at Los Angeles. The financial effects of the ?electricity crunch ""will likely have a relatively small impact on the ?long-run health of the state's economy,"" wrote economist Christopher ?Thornberg, a visiting professor at the university's business school. ?Thornberg based his conclusion on an estimate that the state government might ?have to pay as much as $30 billion for electricity and infrastructure. That, ?he pointed out, is just 2.5 percent of the value of goods and services sold ?in California annually. ?When Thornberg presented his findings at UCLA earlier this month, he was ?confronted by an angry business representative who accused him of having his ?head in the sand. ?Asked about the incident, the UCLA economist conceded that the energy crunch ?is hurting some businesses. ?""I understand that businessmen are going through a tough time right now, but ?I wonder how much of that is the power crisis and how much is due to the fact ?that we are slipping into a recession,"" Thornberg said in an e-mail. ""When ?sales drop, businesspeople tend to point at the first available target -- ?in this case, power. They may be losing sight of the forest for the tree."" ?Thornberg's critics were particularly galled by comments in his report that ?power blackouts will probably have scant effect on California's productivity. ?""An hour without power can be viewed as an extended coffee break for most ?businesses,"" he wrote. ?Mark Roth, president of El Burrito Mexican Food Products in City of Industry ?near Los Angeles, took vehement exception. ?""One of my vendors that makes plastic cups. They were three hours into their ?workday when their power got cut off,"" he said. ""The plastic in the ?(extruding) tubes all turned solid,"" ruining a full day's production. ?ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE?Of course, not all economists play down the plight of California businesses. ?""The business community's voice hasn't been heard,"" said Jack Kyser, chief ?economist for the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp. ""A lot of ?smaller businesses are looking into shutting down or laying people off."" ?Still, Kyser said, he sympathizes with economists who don't yet have the data ?to support the business point of view: ""If you're an academic economist, it's ?very hard. All the evidence is anecdotal."" ?California businesspeople aren't inclined to be as understanding.

Gray ?Davis broke off, the San Francisco Chronicle reported. ?``Perhaps we misjudged their primary concern,'' said Steve Maviglio, the ?governor's spokesman. ``It wasn't resolving their credit issue. It was ?extracting vengeance on the PUC.'' ?In addition to insisting that it be released from the state Public Utilities ?Commission's regulatory grip, PG&E demanded it be allowed to buy back its ?power lines without competitive offers if the state ever decided to sell. In ?addition, it wanted to continue profiting from any telecommunications lines ?or antennas linked to the system, according to a Feb. 28 eight-page proposal ?obtained by the Chronicle and published Sunday. ?PG&E denies the document influenced the outcome between the utility and the ?state. ?``It is ludicrous to suggest that this document caused the negotiations to ?break down,'' said PG&E spokesman Ron Low. ``There were negotiations that ?occurred later and other documents that followed.'' ?At the time of the utility's bankruptcy filing April 6, PG&E Corp. Chairman ?Robert Glynn said no talks had been held for three weeks. PG&E's proposal had ?been delivered about two weeks before talks ceased. ?PG&E has said it's entitled to recoup $9 billion it paid for wholesale power ?because of PUC-regulated rate caps, which kept the utility from passing high ?costs onto customers. ?The proposal said this money ``will be fully recovered in retail rates ?without further CPUC review for prudence or any other purpose,'' the ?Chronicle reported. ?The document went on to demand the PUC drop all proceedings concerning PG&E, ?including an investigation into whether the utility violated California law ?by transferring millions to parent company PG&E Corp. prior to filing ?bankruptcy. ?``They took a position on regulatory matters that was out of touch with ?reality,'' Maviglio said. ?PG&E Corp. spokesman Shawn Cooper declined to comment on the proposal. ?``That document is confidential,'' he said. ?Ratepayer advocates say they're baffled by PG&E's demands. ?``It's like the Japanese insisting that we surrender Hawaii after we beat ?them in World War II,'' said Harvey Rosenfield, consumer advocate for the ?Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights.??------------------------------------------------------------------------------?-----------------------------------------------------------------------?????Conservation drive fuels move to `Cool Roofs' ?At first, it sounds like an off-the-wall idea: resurface the roof of your ?business with white or light-colored coating or material, and you'll save a ?fortune on air conditioning costs. ?But as the state races to launch energy-saving efforts before the summer heat ?wave hits, ``Cool Roofs'' are suddenly one of the hottest conservation ideas ?around, and roofing contractors are spreading the word to their clients. ?Technology companies such as IBM, Solectron and Apple Computer Inc. have ?already added the roofs to some of their buildings. Gov. Gray Davis just ?signed legislation that will funnel an additional $30 million to the state's ?Cool Roofs program, which gives businesses rebates for installing the ?reflective and light-colored roofs. ?Research has shown the roofs reflect the scorching heat of the sun and lower ?building temperatures. In turn, the need to crank up air conditioning is ?greatly reduced. ?``While Cool Roofs do not generally cost more than dark roofs, they have been ?shown to lower cooling costs by 20 percent,'' said California Energy ?Commissioner Art Rosenfeld. ``This simple change will eventually save ?California thousands of megawatts of power.'' ?In Florida and Arizona, whitewashed roofs are common. But in California, most ?commercial and residential roofs are black or dark in color. ?When Solectron, the Milpitas-based electronics manufacturing services ?company, recently purchased a new building in Fremont, the company knew the ?176,000-square-foot flat roof on Building 16 had to be replaced. ?``We thought it would be advantageous for us to put in a Cool Roof,'' said ?Bob Kula, a Solectron spokesman. ``It's worth the investment, and we wanted ?to do it because it's a very important conservation move.'' ?Cooling foam??On a hot summer day, the surface temperature of Building 16's roof can climb ?to 160 degrees. But earlier this week, contractors were busy spraying a ?light-colored polyurethane foam onto the roof's surface. Doing so both drops ?the temperature of the roof by more than 50 degrees and adds extra ?insulation, which enables Solectron to slash its energy costs. ?The coating also extends the roof's life expectancy, which makes it ?cost-effective in the long run. ?Because the systems usually include additional insulation, there shouldn't be ?an increased heating cost during the winter, according to Cool Roofs ?advocates. ?The cost of Solectron's Cool Roof is $750,000, but the company projects it ?will pay for itself in five years because of the energy savings. The company ?will also receive a state rebate of about $15,000 -- or 10 cents a square ?foot -- for the cost of the project. ?Though many commercial businesses have begun to embrace the idea, it will be ?awhile before Cool Roofs catch on in residential neighborhoods. ?Installing a Cool Roof requires using the right kinds of coatings or ?single-ply materials: A homeowner can't just slap a coat of white paint on ?top of asphalt shingles. Furthermore, many homeowners associations do not ?approve of white roofs for cosmetic reasons. ?``Because of architectural issues with residential homes, it's much more ?difficult for this to be used to the extent that it can in industrial ?buildings,'' said Bob Law of BUR Services, a Pleasanton company that is ?installing Solectron's Cool Roof. ?Homeowners need not apply??So far, there is no state rebate for homeowners who install Cool Roofs. ?Others hope the West's energy crisis will change that. Rosenfeld has ?researched Cool Roofs for decades. He worked at the Lawrence Berkeley ?National Laboratory for years, and became interested in energy-efficient ?building design during the energy crisis of the 1970s. ?``I would love to see a residential housing developer say they'd like to do ?the whole neighborhood with Cool Roofs,'' Rosenfeld said. ``We want everybody ?to do it. The Greeks and everyone else who has lived around the Mediterranean ?Sea has understood this for 2,000 years.'' ?Besides Cool Roofs, Rosenfeld and researchers at the Heat Island Group at the ?lab are pushing the larger idea of ``Cool Communities.'' By helping to reduce ?the overall temperatures in cities, Cool Roofs also cut smog. ?Planting shade trees on the south and west sides of a house or commercial ?building also helps to cool temperatures. The sun blazes the strongest in the ?late afternoon, when it begins to set. Deciduous trees that lose their leaves ?in the winter provide much-needed natural shade to buildings in the summer, ?cutting down on the need for air conditioning. ?Heat island syndrome??``With so much asphalt, many communities are becoming heat islands that are a ?few degrees warmer than usual,'' said Hashem Akbari, group leader of the Heat ?Island Group at the lab. ``Cool Roofs, light-colored pavement, and urban ?vegetation can reduce the temperature, and dramatically improve air quality. ?It saves energy. It's like creating an oasis.'' ?------------------------------------------------------------------------------?------------------------------------------------------------------------------?---------------------????????Monday, April 16, 2001 ????PUC president outlines the crisis ?California should make it through the summer electricity crisis in pretty ?good shape, Loretta Lynch, president of the Public Utilities Commission, told ?the Register editorial board in a meeting on Thursday. After Gov. Gray Davis, ?she probably is the second most powerful person in trying to solve the ?electricity crisis. ?She defended the price hikes her commission called for last month of up to 46 ?percent (depending on what the Legislature does when it comes back into ?session next week). She said the hikes, combined with Gov. Davis' ?conservation efforts, ""could be enough"" to get the state through the high ?demand in the summer months without a crisis. ?The Independent System Operator is predicting about 30 blackout days this ?summer based on last summer's usage and this summer's projected power supply. ?She didn't rule out blackouts, but believes conservation and other measures ?will minimize the damage. It will be a close call. We'll soon see whether Ms. ?Lynch's assessment proves too optimistic. ?Although some have criticized her for not being up to speed on the issues, ?she seemed to us a ""quick read"" on a difficult crisis in which almost ?everybody is scrambling for knowledge. And although we disagree with her ?emphasis on increasing government to solve the problem short- and long-term, ?she was open to our suggestions of looking into free-market solutions. ?Here are discussion highlights: ?Freezing prices. Ms. Lynch wants the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to ?freeze the prices that power generators charge for electricity, which would ?give a break to ratepayers and utilities. We objected that price controls ?would put a damper on production, which in the long run could worsen the ?crisis. She countered that, when California still had price controls in 1999, ?""we still had 16 applications"" to build new power plants. ?Cost-plus pricing. She also said it was a ""necessity"" to go back to cost-plus ?pricing, the system in place before ""deregulation,"" in which utilities were ?allowed a specified percentage profit above their costs. ?We pointed out that such a system notoriously produced waste by the utilities ?and such contracts are considered poor business practice because they offer ?no incentive to economize. She countered that better regulation would prevent ?such waste and that, in any case, power surely was cheaper under that system. ?Power rotation. We offered an idea that local businesses have expressed to ?us: Rotating power shutdowns during peak periods, such as one company ?shutting down for a week, with guarantees of power at other times. ""That is a ?great idea,"" she responded. ""The question is implementation. We need to move ?there. We need business coordination with the ISO and the PUC."" ?Basic view. Perhaps her basic view could be summarized in her criticism that ?the existing ""system is for the market, not for the public interest."" By that ?she meant the system in which power generators take advantage of the supply ?shortage to charge extremely high prices, which led to the bankruptcy of PG&E ?and rate increases. ?We pointed out that markets are in the public interest, but that what we have ?now is not a true free market, but a botched ""deregulation."" She countered ?that, because of the unique nature of the electricity market - the constant ?demand and difficulty of storage - some regulation is necessary. ?We agreed that, under the current crisis, instituting a real free market is ?very difficult. But we also believe that all moves to solve this crisis ?should be in the direction of a free market and away from government control ?and ownership. That once the immediate crisis subsides, the shape of the ?permanent recovery should be about a healthy market, not the government. ??------------------------------------------------------------------------------?------------------------------------------------------------------------------?--------------------??[B] FULL/ Sierra Pacific to suspend quarterly dividend --Sierra Pacific cites ?energy crisis uncertainty??????--Sierra Pacific reduces hiring, cuts exec bonuses????New York, April 13 (BridgeNews) - Sierra Pacific Resources Holding Co. will?not pay dividend for the first quarter due to continued uncertainty over the?energy crisis faced by its Nevada unit.

Do these changes potentially render the ?sharp boundaries of the heating-refill season obsolete? ??""The increasing influence of high-deliverability storage may change the ?meaning of the inventory levels,"" wrote James Tobin and James Thompson, ?authors of the EIA report Natural Gas Storage in the United States 2001. ??Is past prologue? ?The return of colder temperatures across much of the country resulted in a ?net withdrawal of 49 billion cubic feet (Bcf) from underground storage during ?the week ended March 30, 2001, according to American Gas Association (AGA) ?estimates. Based on these trends, the expectation is that national natural ?gas storage will end this heating season at around 718 Bcf. That is 40 Bcf ?less than the previous record low set in 1996. ????Factors beyond surging demand influenced this record low. For instance, at ?the beginning of the heating season, natural gas-storage volumes were already ?at their lowest since 1976. Partly, this is attributable to the high natural ?gas prices during the first half of 2000. During this time, gas was sold ?rather than injected to take advantage of what was perceived to be a ?temporary price spike. On top of that, November temperatures were atypically ?low resulting in supply constraints. Now, getting storage levels back up to ?comfortable levels will require injection rates that are significantly higher ?than historical rates. ??As summarized by Barone, an injection rate of 70 Bcf per week will be ?required to reach the 2,800 Bcf mark (or 85% full) by November. This compares ?with the 54 Bcf average weekly injection rate during 2000 and the 61 Bcf ?average rates over the past six years. ""Even with demand elasticity, this ?will be a tall order,"" said Barone. ??According to Tobin and Thompson, the resulting heightened competition for ?supplies will push up prices. ""Prices, though dropping, are expected to ?exceed the average price level of the 2000 refill season."" In other words, ?get ready for another thrilling refill season in terms of price volatility. ??Rethinking the meaning of inventory levels?This season, however, historical clues alone may be inadequate in predicting ?the refill season thrill ride. The situation may be moderated somewhat by ?changes in storage management over the past decade as a result of natural ?gas-market restructuring. ??""Many storage gas owners (marketers and other third parties) are minimizing ?inventories in an attempt to synchronize their buying and selling activities ?more effectively with market needs while minimizing their business costs,"" ?said Tobin and Thompson. ??In the United States, there are three principal types of underground storage: ?depleted reservoirs in oil and gas fields, aquifers and salt cavern ?formations. Salt caverns are characterized by high withdrawal and injection ?rates and can usually complete several full cycles per year. This is ?typically referred to as high-deliverability, multi-cycle (HDMC) storage. ??Nationwide, there are a total of 415 underground storage sites of which 27 ?are salt caverns and 348 are depleted oil or gas fields. The remainder are ?aquifers. All together, the storage capacity is 3,899 Bcf (including working ?gas) with a daily deliverability of 77,734 million cubic feet (mmcf) per day. ?The 27 salt cavern sites provide 11,416 mmcf of the daily deliverability, ?about 15% of the total. ??""Reflecting the change in focus within the natural gas-storage industry ?during recent years, the largest growth in daily withdrawal capability has ?been from high-deliverability storage sites, which are mainly salt cavern ?storage reservoirs,"" said the authors of the EIA study. ??Since 1993, when access to interstate underground natural gas storage became ?completely open, daily withdrawal capability from high-deliverability storage ?facilities has grown by 62% and the number of sites has increased from 21 to ?27. During this period, the average cycling rate at these facilities has ?increased from 1.66 to 2.10. ??""Because gas can be rapidly injected/withdrawn from these ?[high-deliverability storage] sites, how full they are on November 1 has less ?significance than inventory levels for depleted or aquifer storage, which are ?designed to cycle (deplete) inventories once a heating season,"" Tobin and ?Thompson said. For example, a high deliverability facility with a working gas ?capacity of 1 Bcf could possibly cycle 12 Bcf during the calendar year. ?Consequently, the storage operations are not dictated by the need for ?seasonal backup but rather are a function of customers needs. ??Storage assets grow in volume and value?While underground natural gas storage inventories can provide the means to ?meet peak requirements quickly, this can only work up to a point because ?there is not enough known salt dome storage in the country to accommodate a ?total change in strategy. Nevertheless, the storage industry is responding to ?these changes in demand profiles by acquiring, expanding and retrofitting. ??Falcon Gas Storage Co. recently acquired the Hill-Lake natural gas-storage ?facility 100 miles west of Dallas/Ft. Worth in Eastland County from TXU Lone ?Star Pipeline Co. The Hill-Lake facility has operated as a single-cycle ?natural gas-storage facility since the early 1960s. Falcon plans to add more ?compression, retrofit surface facilities and drill horizontal ?injection/withdrawal wells in order to convert the Hill-Lake facility into an ?HDMC facility capable of four to six annual inventory cycles with peak ?withdrawal capacity in excess of 300,000 million British thermal units ?(mmBtu) per day. ??""We are very fortunate to have had the unique opportunity to purchase an ?operating single-cycle gas storage facility that not only can be retrofitted ?for HDMC service at an acceptable cost, but also is in such a strategic ?location,"" said John M. Hopper, Falcon Gas Storage Co. president. ??Alberta Energy Co. Ltd. said recently it may increase its Wild Goose ?underground storage facility near Gridley in northern California from 14 to ?38 Bcf. Withdrawal capability could rise to 650 mmcf a day from 200 mmcf a ?day. ??""We have had numerous discussions with power generators, marketers and ?industrial users of natural gas who have told us they'd be very interested in ?seeing another open season at Wild Goose,"" Ben Ledene, Wild Goose vice ?president, said in a statement. ??In March, Aquila, a wholesale gas and power marketer, agreed to buy a salt ?cavern storage project from SG Resources of Houston. The storage facility ?will become operational in 2002. By 2004, the facility will have 12 Bcf of ?capacity. The facility is designed so that 100% of its inventory can be ?delivered in 10 days. ??Market Hub Partners LP (MHP), a division of Duke Energy Gas Transmission, ?filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for authorization to ?begin a $9 million expansion of its salt cavern storage facility in Egan, La. ?The company plans to incrementally expand from 12 to 16 Bcf, reaching 16 Bcf ?of working storage capacity by 2005. MHP also has plans to expand the HDMC ?services in Copiah, Miss. from 3 Bcf to 9 Bcf. ??""The development of the Copiah facility will greatly enhance our ability to ?meet the time-sensitive injection and withdrawal requirements of today's ?storage customers,"" said Gregory Rizzo, president of MHP. ??With the continued growth in natural gas-fired generation, Rizzo's comment ?may encapsulate the sentiment that demonstrates a slow but certain shift in ?injection-withdrawal patterns, at least for HDMC assets. As end-use needs ?shift, the concept of a refill and heating season may follow suit. ???"

"Richard, earlier today I spoke with Barry Friedberg, Schultes' New York 
counsel to get some idea of what areas Schultes' Ohio counsel would be 
interested in during tomorrow's discussion.? Friedberg explained that the 
Ohio counsel are ""classic plaintiff's lawyers"" - they are not that familiar 
with the issues and will tend to ask broad generalized questions.? Friedberg 
also noted that they may be unaware that Enron is a defendant in the two 
California actions and will likely be unaware that Enron is the only 
defendant who has not cross-complained against Schultes. For purposes of 
insuring that any deposition testimony in the Ohio case is not used against 
any defendant in the bondholders' litigation,? Friedberg thought it would be 
a good idea to try a limit any discussion to post-closing events and, more 
specifically, whether Enron personnel were privy to any discussions with SDI 
or McDonald regarding (1) the decision to fire Schultes, (2) Schultes' 
alleged dishonesty and (3) Schultes' alleged incompetence.? Friedberg 
explained that Busse's defenses to the defamation and wrongful termination 
claims are (1) that he did not make any defamatory statements and (2) if he 
did, they were true.? The problem with the second defense is that it may 
affect our defenses in the bondholders' litigation.? If Enron or others were 
aware that Schultes was dishonest or incompetent it will be important to know 
when and how they learned of such information.? Ideally, they learned it 
after the closing and only through discussions between McDonald and SDI.

"The Integrated Solutions Center (ISC) has received recommendations from you, 
our eHRonline users, on ways we might improve the time entry process as it 
relates to holiday pay.  Based upon these suggestions, the ISC is 
implementing a new time entry process to record holiday time, which is 
effective immediately, beginning with the February 16-28, 2001, time-entry 
period.  

Holiday pay for all eligible employees must be entered as &Company Observed 
Holiday8, and the recent company-observed holiday of President,s Day (Monday, 
February 19, 2001) must be coded &Company Observed Holiday8.  However, if you,
re an employee who works a 12-hour shift schedule, there are no changes to 
your time entry process for Holiday pay.  Please continue to record your 
holiday time in the usual manner.

If you,re a salaried, non-exempt employee and you work a holiday, you must 
enter &Company Observed Holiday8 for that holiday and enter &Regular Work 
Time8 for all hours worked on the holiday to ensure proper payment of 
overtime for the day.  

Discretionary holiday time has been limited to eight (8) hours for all 
eligible employees, per the Enron Policy on Work Hours/Holidays/Vacation (<
http://hrweb.enron.com/policyandprocedure/docs/12-hours.pdf>).   eHRonline 
will not allow you to record more than eight (8) hours per calendar year 
under the &Discretionary Holiday8 time-entry code.  

Detailed instructions on coding holiday time are available within SAP 
eHRonline Process Bulletin HR -01-04, which can be accesed through the 
following link:

EnPower"" deals. Also, a change has been made to the SP-15 volumes in the 3/2 
sheet. This change was made per Daniel Kang at EES and Chris Foster at EPMI.

Good Afternoon, 
        Credit has an issue with Texex Energy Partners that you should be aware of.  We received an amendment of an LC that reduces the coverage amount to $4mm and extends the expiry date to 1/15/02.  It covers physical MTM which we are in the money approx $2mm.  I assume that we are not performing on these contracts (some go out to 6/02), but Texex has not terminated.  I believe we should call Texex to extend the LC to protect the value of these contracts and if they refuse, we terminate and draw on the current LC.  Do you buy into this strategy?  Please advise at your convenience.

Thanks, 

Max Sonnonstine

Carl:

I was recently informed via Janet Bowers at NNG that there have been some issues with regard to the gas contract to serve the Pleasant Valley Peaker.  In order to have someone address your issues, I have passed on your concerns to Darron Giron who works Mid-Market and Origination on the Central Gas Desk.  Darron's number is 713-853-9573.  I have also made the VP of the Central Gas Desk aware of your concerns.  You should be getting a call from Darron in the next couple of days after he has had a chance to get up to speed on the transaction.

I am now doing long term power marketing in the ECAR region and thought it was best to let the gas desk address this; however, please feel free to contact me should the situation warrant.

Thanks

Ettera issues:


1.  When hourly is asked to manage a day ahead position we cannot adjust the position in ettera and makes it a worthless tool, the position cannot be found.  We have to adjust the day ahead position in the portal directly.

2.  If we have a day ahead position and adjust it hourly it will change back to the original schedule when we submit another schedule.

3.  Frontera is too time consuming and confusing when we have to show a buy from frontera and a sell to frontera when we buy from them.

4.  The whole process takes to long, on average it usually takes 5 minutes to put an hourly schedule in when it only takes a minute when done directly in the portal.


Thats all I got, I hope it helps.

Tana:
As we discussed, here is my list of amendments that are according to my 
records in various stages of negotiation:

1. Allegheny energy - Patricia Clark sent to Frank Davis her comments on June 
15th by e-mail.  I responded on June 19th and have never heard back from 
her.  Most of her comments we could not accept.  None of her comments have 
been run by Dave.

2. Imperial Oil -  Grant Oh was handling this.  They had 3 comments. most of 
which we could not accept.  I spoke with Grant about this around June 6th and 
have never heard back from him.  None of their proposed changes have been run 
by Dave.

3. Kennecott Coal Sales Company - A draft amendment letter which Dave F. has 
approved was sent to them on May 15th.  My contact there is Jim Sobule  Wayne 
Gresham is alos involved in this.  I have never heard back from Jim. 

4. Arco - We received by e-mail comments from David Dyck at Arco in March.  
Tori Kuykendall and Grant Oh are involved from the Enron side.  I responded  
to David Dyck by e-mail on March 10th and have never heard anything further 
on this.  None of their comments or my response has been reviewed by Dave.

5. Chevron - Canada - I received a letter from Bruce Borwick  on January 31st 
which I responded to and have never heard anything further from them.  Dave 
has not reviewed their comments or my response.

6. Cargill - I sent to Mike Pederson a form of amendment letter which I don't 
think has been signed.  They wanted a minor change to the confidentiality 
language.  Dave has not seen this but in the event that Cargill comes back to 
life, i doubt that he will have a problem with it.

7. Cinergy - I sent a draft amendment letter which dave approved to John 
Dirheimer on May 15th.   To my knowledge it has not been signed.

8. Duke Energy - I sent a draft amendment letter to John Puett on May 15th 
which Dave approved.  To my knowledge, it has not been signed.

9. Talisman - we have been exchanging drafts of a revised ETA for months.  My 
contact there is Ann Love.  We are close to reaching agreement with them and 
mark has been involved in some of the early discussions.  I am sending to 
Dave a mark-up of the revised agreement for his approval.


All of the ETA amendment letters and the Talisman revised ETA are in my 
directory under specproj/online.

Hello Zhiyong,
	I have implemented an enhancement to avoid the problem of restarting the Sitara EOLBridge when there are missing startdate and enddate.  This fix will take care of this morning's problem.

EOL will be sent a Failed status similar to the following:

Subject:	Sitara EOL Bridge Problem Today

The problem we faced today was due to 2 eol deal packets (2098073, 2099764) not having startdate and enddate.  Missing these 2 tibco message fields caused the bridge to bounce and resulted in the queue to build up while the bridge is starting up. (The bridge takes 2 minute for startup).  Each time these deals are sent/resent, it continuously cause the Sitarar EOLBridge to restart, thus magnifying the buildup of the queue.

The corrective action we are taking at our end is to build a rejection logic when eol packets do not have start and/or enddate.

generally find it far easier to deal with each other than with foreingers.  
In some Japanese, this unease can lead to some unappealing attitudes and 
behaviors.

The Japanese maintain a very clear distinction between an individual's public 
and private faces, so that it is rare to catch them expressing hostile views 
of foreigners.  Nevertheless, every now and then, a politician's remarks will 
land him in trouble. 

You might find the enclosed article interesting.  By the way, Ishihara spent 
two weeks denying that he had done anything wrong and only apologized in the 
past couple of days.

      Ishihara acknowledges word was inappropriate 

                Yomiuri Shimbun

                Tokyo Gov. Shintaro Ishihara late Wednesday acknowledged in a 
statement
                that it was ""inappropriate"" for him to have used the word 
""sangokujin"" and
                said that he regrets having caused misunderstanding and 
hurting foreigners in
                general by using the derogatory term in a recent speech. 

                It was the first time that Ishihara had clearly admitted to 
having hurt foreign
                residents by using the word, which has discriminatory 
connotations.
                ""Sangokujin"" literally means ""people from third countries."" 
Yet it was used
                after World War II as a derisory term for people from former 
Japanese
                colonies, primarily Koreans, living in Japan. 

                On April 9, he told members of the Ground Self-Defense Forces 
in Tokyo
                at a ceremony, ""Atrocious crimes have been committed 
repeatedly by
                sangokujin and (other) foreigners who have illegally entered 
Japan. It is to
                be expected that they will riot in the event of a major 
disaster."" 

                Although he used the word to refer to those who have 
illegally entered the
                country, it had a different meaning from what he meant to 
say, he said. 

                ""I did not intend to hurt Korean or other foreign residents 
in Japan, and I am
                extremely regretful,"" Ishihara said in the statement, 
promising that he would
                never again use the ""inappropriate word,"" which is prone to 
cause
                misunderstanding. 

                On April 14, he expressed regret over his remarks, but 
stopped short of
                acknowledging the derogatory import of the word ""sangokujin"" 
and failed to
                apologize for having hurt the feelings of foreigners. 

                Wednesday's statement was made in response to demands from
                metropolitan assembly members of Minshuto (Democratic Party 
of Japan)
                asking that he retract his remarks and make a public apology. 

                Ishihara handed the statement to senior Minshuto members of 
the assembly
                after they held a meeting earlier in the day. 

                The statement, to which Ishihara will affix the governor's 
official seal, will
                become an official document. 

                Hidejiro Kawai, secretary general of the Minshuto group 
within the
                assembly, said, ""An official document carries weight, which 
will be
                tantamount to the governor's withdrawal of his remarks and 
apology,""
                indicating that the group will not take the matter further.

Subject: OECD Meetings June 26-28, Paris

Ken: While in Europe last week I arranged a meeting with Douglas Worth, 
Secretary General of the Business Industry Advisory Committee (BIAC) to the 
OECD. Doug headed the Washington office of IBM until he retired a few years 
ago, then joined Carla Hills firm and two years ago became Secretary General 
of the BIAC. During his Washington service for IBM he headed up the Trade 
Committee of the United States Council for International Business to which we 
have long been a member. 

Doug and I discussed the promotion of energy services and he had several 
suggestions which I found to be excellent. He is a top level person who 
recommends policy to the OECD. He suggested that he would like to organize a 
meeting with you briefing OECD ministers and senior staff on business plans 
of today, changes in the market place and what is necessary to advance a 
business in today's atmosphere. Doug believes that having such a high level 
briefing advances the cause of business and competitive policies which is the 
priority of the OECD.

He also called my attention to the OECD Forum 2000 to be held June 26-28 in 
Paris. Doug has offered to contact Dennis Lamb, another former Washingtonian 
in the diplomatic service who is arranging the program and if you are 
available he would ask that you be a primetime speaker. It covers the type of 
issues that you addressed at the WTO in Seatlle and the World Economic Forum 
in Davos.  (I would dearly love to have a few minutes briefing from you on 
your Davos appearances).

I think these presentations at the OECD, one a private luncheon with 
Ministers that Doug thinks would be an informal presentation and the 
possibility of a slot on the June 26-28 program would be excellent for our 
cause and hope that your schedule either in June or later can accommodate 
this opportunity.

Joe

PS: Doug and his eco-staff director Ms. Hanne Rosenbaum (she knows and has 
worked with John Palmisano) told me that one of their main themes this year 
is eco-efficiency which seems to fit our Enron goals.

"All:  Attached for the reading pleasure of the CA team is the Andersen report 
- ""Energy Crisis in the Western U.S."" Reproduced below is a related article, 
and that is followed by the text of the Andersen press release on the 
report.  Ray



	NGI's Daily Gas Price Index 
published : April 25, 2001
	Andersen Warns Of Increased State/Federal Tensions 
	The likelihood of friction between state and federal regulators increasing 
over deregulation plans if states slow or walk away from retail competition 
is just one of several important implications resulting from the ongoing 
shockwave that has rolled through the Western energy markets, according to a 
new report issued Tuesday by Andersen. 
	The report, ""Energy Crisis in the Western United States: Lessons for 
Navigating Regulatory and Market Minefields,"" was unveiled by Andersen's 
North American Energy Consulting Practice at a Washington, D.C., briefing. 
	David Jermain, principal with Andersen's North American Energy Consulting 
Practice, noted that the report identifies eight overriding implications 
emanating from the Western energy crisis. ""These aspects of the California 
virus will shape the longer-term operations of the Western grid, the regional 
and national economy, domestic energy policy and the industry's evolution,"" 
he added. 
	The eight implications singled out in the Andersen report are: 
	Increased deregulation uncertainty and risk 
	Reduced investor confidence 
	Contributing factor in economic softening 
	Increased pressure on the Western grid 
	Unbundling failures that push companies back to portfolio strategies 
	Ineffectiveness in changing siting and development restrictions 
	Procurement management that alters user-utility negotiating leverage; and 
	Increased emphasis on distributed generation and new technologies 
	""Tensions and differences between state and federal regulators raise the 
specter of repeating the regulatory and political conundrum California's 
investor-owned utilities have been facing,"" Jermain said. If federal 
initiatives open wholesale markets while retail markets remain regulated, a 
crucial question emerges, namely whether state regulators will pass-through 
higher wholesale costs if they should occur. ""Tensions between state and 
federal regulators over policies on deregulation will grow if states delay or 
abandon retail competition,"" Jermain stated. 
	As to the California situation creating increased pressure on the Western 
grid, Jermain noted that ""Even as capacity increases and demand reductions 
work to resolve the California crisis, these solutions have long-term 
implications for the Western grid."" Such implications include a realistic 
chance that California could become an ""energy island"" as a result of 
near-term reduction in available regional resources for export to California, 
according to the Andersen report. Also, there could be increased emphasis on 
security control to protect against overall Western grid failure as 
sub-regions have difficulties. 
	Along with yesterday's report, Andersen also issued the results of an 
Andersen survey of senior executives from 16 non-California utilities 
detailing their views of the implications of the California power crisis for 
their companies and the industry. The survey was conducted between February 
19, 2001, and March 2, 2001, by Knowledge Systems & Research Inc. of 
Syracuse. 
	On the deregulation front, nearly all the executives surveyed said they 
believe recent California events will slow the pace of deregulation over the 
next five years for states that have not begun or finished writing 
restructuring legislation. None believe that it will result in advanced 
states deciding to re-regulate markets, although many states will review 
their legislation to assess the risk of duplicating California's current 
situation and make any changes necessary to avoid it. 
	As to legislation at the federal level, the survey found that few executives 
suggest that the California situation will spark national energy 
policy/legislation. Other executives believe that it will be a continuing 
issue but, because of state-to-state variances, Congress will be unable to 
pass any comprehensive measures or force states to a restructuring timeline. 
	Turning to company strategies, most of the executives surveyed do not see any 
changes to their business models or strategies for generation, distribution 
or supply procurement as a response to the situation in California. However, 
many have, among other things, expanded their risk management programs, 
reduced spot market purchases and started emphasizing long-term supply 
contracts. Those executives facing price caps are rethinking their stance on 
them, according to the Andersen survey.

ower companies and regulators must take steps to avoid spread of California 
Power virus: Andersen analysis

WASHINGTON, D.C., April 24, 2001 * A &new virus spawned in California8 poses 
formidable challenges requiring new strategies on the part of power 
companies, regulators and policymakers to contain and reverse its damage, 
according to Energy Crisis in the Western United States: Lessons for 
Navigating Regulatory and Market Minefields, a new Andersen report released 
today. 
&The implications for the development of competitive energy markets go far 
beyond the Western United States,8 Andersen,s national utility practice head 
Matthew D. Smith told a Washington briefing. &Unfortunately, California has 
taught the nation that regulatory and political barriers can create and 
sustain an energy crisis.8

&California has demonstrated that the risks in the electricity industry, if 
not properly acknowledged and managed, can simultaneously and profoundly 
impact all market participants. To be effectively managed, these risks need 
to be exposed, assumed or shared, measured and monitored. When they are 
hidden or ignored, all parties can potentially suffer. A shared, integrated 
view of these risks, and a strategy for their assumption and management, is 
critical to avoiding rapid value destruction within the energy market,8 Smith 
said.

An Andersen survey of senior utility executives outside California, also 
released at the briefing, indicates most utility companies believe they 
inoculated themselves against the California virus so that it is unlikely to 
affect their operations beyond slowing the pace of deregulation and 
increasing investor scrutiny. However, based on the potential implications it 
sees of the California situation, Andersen believes a series of booster shots 
are advisable for power companies and regulators. &To deliver reliable 
service at a predictable cost in today,s environment, companies must focus on 
market integration by developing new and innovative relationships between 
suppliers, customers, employees and investors ) while working with government 
officials and regulators to chart a smoother transition to a deregulated 
power market,8 according to Smith.

Eight Implications
The Andersen report identified eight overriding implications emanating from 
the Western energy crisis that are shaping the longer-term operations of the 
Western grid, the regional and national economy, domestic energy policy and 
the industry,s evolution:
1. Increased deregulation uncertainty and risk ) Tension and differences 
between state and federal regulators raise the specter of repeating the 
regulatory and political conundrum California,s investor-owned utilities have 
faced. If federal initiatives open wholesale markets while retail markets 
remain regulated, a crucial question is raised: Will state regulators 
pass-through higher wholesale costs if they should materialize? Tensions 
between state and federal regulators over policies on deregulation will grow 
if states delay or abandon retail competition. 
As wholesale markets are deregulated and RTOs begin operating, the prudence 
principles that state regulators have used for many years may have to be 
changed. For example, if FERC and RTO monitors determine that deregulated 
wholesale markets operate fairly, prices derived from those markets must be 
considered reasonable. If so, these costs should be allowed into 
state-regulated retail rates without regard to the prudence principles state 
regulators have used for years. Therefore, utilities, traditional burden of 
proving costs are or are not justifiable shifts to regulators.

2. Reduced investor confidence ) Prior to deregulation, stringent prudence 
review and disallowance of generation costs in the rate base made regulatory 
risk largely uncontrollable, killing IOU interests in most new investment. A 
major purpose of deregulation was to create an environment in which risk 
could be managed, but California,s political and regulatory environment 
provides only a limited ability to manage risks. The confidence and 
perceptions needed to support investment decision-making will be slow to 
return given the approach of the state to remedy the crisis.

3. Contributing factor in economic softening ) Uncertain energy reliability 
and higher costs can drive-out marginal businesses, cause healthy companies 
to constrain expansion, and lead new entrants to question whether to make new 
investments. As such, an extended energy crisis contributes to inflation 
pressures and may slow economic growth.

4. Increased pressure on the Western grid ) Even as capacity increases and 
demand reductions work to resolve the California crisis, these solutions have 
long-term implications for the Western Grid. These include a realistic 
possibility of California becoming an &energy island8 as a result of 
near-term reduction in available regional resources for export to California; 
increased emphasis on security control to protect against overall Western 
grid failure as sub-regions have problems; RTO requirements to strengthen 
locally available supplies to bolster overall system reliability; longer-term 
development of new plants using plentiful coal resources and clean coal 
technology will alter the pattern of imports into California; and the 
emergence of Mexico as a major supplier to southern California and Arizona, 
contributing to a bifurcation of the Western Grid into northern and southern 
markets

5. Unbundling failures that push companies back to portfolio strategies ) For 
California investor-owned utilities, unbundling has achieved neither the 
least-cost solution sought by regulators nor value maximization targeted by 
investors. This necessitates a reevaluation of portfolio management 
strategies potentially involving generation, transmission, power trading and 
marketing, and retail businesses in multiple geographies serving multiple 
markets.

6. Ineffectiveness in changing siting and development restrictions ) 
California,s retail price caps and multiple explanations for the crisis have 
left accelerated siting processes and environmental standards changes open to 
challenge by various interests. In addition, limiting application of new 
siting orders only to small generators contributes to uncertainty and 
investor hesitancy.

7. Procurement management that alters user-utility negotiating leverage ) 
Competitive markets compel participants ) suppliers, marketers, large 
industrial buyers, etc. ) to strategically manage procurement as a critical 
value-driver. Because risk is explicitly shared and always has the potential 
of shifting advantage to either seller or buyer, the sophistication of 
negotiations and contracts increases as competitive markets evolve.

8. Increased emphasis on distributed generation and new technologies ) 
California,s reliability and price challenges have triggered a re-emergence 
of energy crisis measures from the 1970s. End-users are investing in 
solutions they control, and the distributed generation market is being 
aggressively developed among large retailers, industrial users and 
residential customers. This makes possible the development of microgrids 
connecting consumers in local areas and related changes in traditional grid 
systems, from modifications in interconnection agreements to changing 
definitions of reserve margins and system reliability.
Industry Executives, Response
Senior executives from sixteen non-California utilities with a combined 
market capitalization over $120 billion and $145 billion in revenues 
responded to an Andersen survey with their views of the implications of the 
California power crisis for their companies and for the industry. The survey, 
conducted between February 19, 2001 and March 2, 2001 by Knowledge Systems & 
Research, Inc. of Syracuse, found that the companies are observing the 
California situation carefully, expect a slowing ) but not a turnaround -- of 
deregulation, and believe their internal plans and preparations are on-target 
for the changing environment:
Deregulation - Nearly all executives believe recent California events will 
slow the pace of deregulation over the next five years for states that have 
not begun or finished writing restructuring legislation. None believe that it 
will cause advanced states to re-regulate markets, although many states will 
review their legislation to assess their risk of duplicating California,s 
current situation and make any changes necessary to avoid it. 
National legislation - Few executives suggest the situation will initiate 
national energy policy/legislation; others believe it will be a continuing 
issue but, because of state-to-state variances, Congress will be unable to 
pass any comprehensive measures or force states to a restructuring timeline. 
Some expect additional state-level legislation. 
Company strategies - Most do not see any changes to their business models or 
strategies for generation, distribution or supply procurement as a response 
to the situation in California. However, many have expanded their risk 
management programs, reduced spot market purchases, begun emphasizing 
long-term supply contracts, planning new power generation capacity, and 
started hedging with futures trades. Those facing price caps are rethinking 
their stance on them 
Investor scrutiny ) Many executives indicate their shareholders are aware of 
the situation and investors -- particularly institutional investors -- are 
more heavily scrutinizing their actions. Many say news coverage has prompted 
retail, commercial and industrial customer skepticism of industry 
restructuring. 
Transmission deregulation - Many executives agree the California situation 
will increase interest in FERC,s regional transmission organizations (RTO) 
deregulation effort.
Utility Company Action Items
Both to guard against a sudden California cascade and as a potentially 
powerful competitive thrust, forward-thinking utilities should bolster their 
basic preparedness with a variety of tactics -- or inoculations -- 
specifically aimed to combat a potential California power virus, according to 
Andersen partner Mark Moskovitz:
Improve procurement management and risk management capabilities - To manage 
exposure to volatile supply and demand shifts, organizations must be sure 
that comprehensive and clear supply procedures, controls, decision points, 
risk limits and communications are in place. 
Plan and design innovative rate and pricing structures ) Companies and 
regulators must focus on communicating price signals that create value for 
both the customer and the provider. Innovative rate and pricing structures 
that more closely tie the customer,s price to the real cost of supply will 
better signal the value of the service as well as providing more accurate 
information upon which both end user and supplier can make decisions. 
Increase emphasis on demand side management (DSM) strategies ) In addition to 
new pricing strategies to help achieve and maintain supply-demand 
equilibrium, companies must now focus on employing more extensive and 
innovative demand side management programs. These programs may offer 
significant benefits with limited risk to both the customer and energy 
supplier. 
Assess the supply and generation dynamics in adjacent jurisdictions ) 
Companies must take a broader view ) beyond typical geographic market 
definitions -- of the economics of generation and related business decisions 
in an increasingly volatile market in which supply will follow the best 
prices. 
Develop contingency plans for the continued deferral of new generation 
capacity ) In the face of potential ongoing generation capacity shortages, 
companies and regulators must be prepared to move with a portfolio of 
strategies to meet demand, including for example DSM, flexible pricing and 
distributed generation. In addition, they should explore efficiency-improving 
upgrades to existing facilities and seize any opportunity to accelerate 
near-term construction plans. 
Proactively address potential organizational disruption ) As regulatory and 
economic changes continue to churn the industry waters and companies adjust 
and/or restructure, they must be highly cogniscent of, sensitive to, and 
directly address employees, concerns with information about the company,s 
future and theirs,.
Industry/Regulatory Lessons
There are also a number of broad primary lessons the electric power industry 
-- nationally and internationally -- should take away from its first major 
domestic test case in deregulation and restructuring, according to Andersen 
principal David O. Jermain:
Simplify market design. 
Build a continuing role for regulators. 
Maintain communications with multiple constituent interests. 
Prepare contingency plans for extreme stress conditions. 
Couple real-time retail pricing with transparently priced wholesale 
competition. 
Provide special incentives for RTO investment, formation and development. 
Break down regulatory and political barriers to market signals and responses.

Subject: Enron Reuters folder: FRANCE: Metals web platform EMETRA may add 
ferro-alloys.


FRANCE:
Metals web platform EMETRA may add ferro-alloys.

11/20/2000
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2000.

PARIS, Nov 20 (Reuters) - Metals internet trading exchange EMETRA may add
selected ferro-alloys to its existing range of non-ferrous metals products,
Heinz Schimmelbusch, managing director of Safeguard International Fund, said
on Monday.

Safeguard has a stake in EMETRA, alongside Enron Metals and Internet Capital
Group .
""There's no reason why tin or nickel are being traded on and certain
ferro-alloys are not being traded,"" Schimmelbusch said at a Metal Bulletin
conference in Paris.

""One would be tempted to add ferro-alloy industry standards to these new
exchange-based trading operations.""

EMETRA launched physical trade of non-ferrous metals in October via its
website at www.emetra.com.

A derivatives platform, developed in conjunction with Deutsche Boerse, is due
to follow in the first quarter of next year.

Futures and derivatives are the key to adding value to ferro-alloys trade via
e-commerce, Schimmelbusch said.

""I don't think that physical platforms add anything unless they're connected
to futures pricing,"" Schimmelbusch said, citing the volatile nature of
ferro-alloys markets and the need to provide a transparent hedging mechanism.

Such hedging mechanisms that existed in the industry were confined to
privately negotiated deals, he added.

But as business migrated to web-based platforms more formal futures markets
might emerge, he said, pointing out that ferroalloy producers could already
offset power cost risk through a range of trading options.

""In the future it will be possible to lock in margins and eliminate volatility
over certain periods of time, and at a much lower cost than can be done
privately now,"" he said.

EMETRA was founded in February as a joint venture between LME ring trader MG
Plc - subsequently bought by U.S. energy and power giant Enron Corp - Internet
Capital Group and Safeguard International Fund LP.

Dear Vince

Please may I reintroduce myself. We met last year at the Sydney EPRM
conference which my company KWI sponsored. I chaired the session at which
you spoke.

As you may remember, my company, KWI are one of the world's leading
provider
of systems (kW3000) and consultancy for energy, trading and risk
management.
We have over 60 clients worldwide including many of the world's leading
energy companies (not Enron unfortunately):

North America
- TVA
- Ontario Power
- Cinergy
- Bonneville Power

Europe
- Enel
- ATEL
- Electrabel
- EDF

Nordic
- Vattenfall
- Fortum
- Sydkraft
- Statkraft
- Birka Energi
- Norsk Hydro

Each year we stage a ""KWI Users Forum"" - a 2-day event attended by leading
trading and risk staff from our clients. Last year there were about 100
delegates. The agenda primarily focusses on issues surrounding risk
management for the energy sector.

The agenda comprises keynote presentations on burning risk issues from
industry leading energy speakers and practical workshops focussed around
using our software.

This years event is at a luxury hotel in the wonderful Spanish city of
Barcelona and runs from the evening of Sunday September 9th to Tuesday
September 11th. The main conference dinner is on the Monday evening and is
always a memorable event. This year it is in a leading Barcelona restaurant
preceded by a bus tour of the city with a stop for pre-dinner drinks.

I would like to invite you to make the opening keynote address, the
highlight of the conference.

The subject could be:

*    a general energy risk related topic
*    a general insight into the secret of Enron's continued success in
the energy markets
*    your thoughts on the future development on energy markets (and other
commodity related - bandwidth etc.) worldwide

Obviously, we would cover all your delagate costs including accomodation,
food and drink.

What's in it for you ? Many of our users are some the energy sectors
leading
risk thinkers and I'm sure you would enjoy meeting them and exchanging
views.

Please let me know if you are able to accept the invitation.

Best regards


David Warwick - Marketing Dierctor and Co-founder

Phillip, this liquidation looks like it relates to Reliant contract 813, 
Sitara deal  459075,  which was booked as a physical storage withdrawal for 
January production in the January GL.  I don't normally see liquidations for 
physical storage.  Is there anything else you can tell me about this?

Milton, can you confirm that this is really physical storage?

Subject: PX credits & Schedule F in the PG&E bankruptcy

PG&E filed their Schedule F which displays its nonpriority unsecured claims.  
Many of the claims were listed as unknown in amount.  The PX credit amounts 
were listed as disputed.   Two PX credit amounts were specified in the 
Schedule F:

Enron Energy Marketing      $201,964,905.64
Enron Energy Services       $ 19,737,979.97
Total disclosed PX credit   $221,702,885.61

Note that in the claims that were listed as unknown in amount, none were 
described as PX Credit in nature. 

Two points to be made: 1) this information is now public (but on page 5,066 
of 17,096 on a CD), along with $53,985,167 in other Enron related claims, and 
2) our calculation of the PX credit was $392,416,534 at the beginning of May.

Regards,


Michael

"I would like to thank all of you for putting quality time and effort into 
this important process.  There is nothing more important to ENA than 
attracting and retaining the most talanted and innovative people.

Effectively immediately, written and oral feedback for commercial managers 
and directors can be delivered. As per our discussion, the PRC process is 
primarily a feedback, performance management and staff planning tool.  It 
provides a data point for bonus purposes; however, it is not the only 
determinant.  In the interest of ensuring the most effective performance 
management tool, I would suggest that we implement the following:
 a)For employees ranked in the strong and above categories, the ultimate 
ranking should not be communicated and the message should focus on progress 
towards identified commercial goals and objectives and progress towards the 
further development of desirable leadership and commerical capabilities. 
Written and oral feedback should be delivered immediately;
 b) For employees ranked in the satisfactory, needs improvement and issues 
category, the ultimate ranking should be communicated to ensure approriate 
documentation of performance and to stimulate a plan to rectify or cure 
performance issues.  For the satisfactory category, the message should focus 
on increasing deal-flow, financial performance and productivity.  The bar is 
always being raised.  For the needs improvement category, the message should 
focus on turning around poor performance over the next six months.  For the 
issues category, the business unit manager should determine, in conjunction 
with your HR rep., the appropriate plan to find a better ""fit"" in the 
organization or counsel out.  Regardless, the ENA Office of the Chairman will 
require a written plan of action for all employees in the needs improvement 
and issues category from the business unit manager documenting the plan of 
action to rectify performance.

Vice President ranking can not be communicated until after the Enron VP PRC 
currently scheduled for July 31st.  I anticipate a similar process as above 
with our officer feedback process.  Associate and Analyst rankings can not be 
communicated until after the Enron A&A PRC currently scheduled for July 19th.

Other identified action items from the meetings include:
 a) the HR group will put together a ""profile and performance book"" for ENA's 
A&A's to ensure our representatives can augment performance information at 
the July 19th meeting;
 b) ENA will be aggressively attempting to retain highest performing A&A's to 
continue rotating within ENA;
 c) ENA will be holding an additional ""off-cycle"" A&A super-saturday for 
Houston and Portland in August to augment our capabilities in this area;
 and d) your HR representative is building a pipeline of outside employment 
candidates for your review each week.  Please review these resumes in a 
timely basis and let them know your interest or lack thereof.

Please communicate to your organization as appropriate.

Regards
Mark and Dave"
"For years I followed the positive contributions ENRON made to the community 
and its staff.  I always dreamed of working for a company that truly cared.  
My prayers were answered.  I am proud to be a part of this team and look 
forward to many years of prosperity and success.  After working for a private 
practice for 10 years and being told that the corporate work environment was 
impersonal, I have seen ENRON promote and display respect, integrity, 
communication and excellence.  If someone gives respect, the person receiving 
it might build up their self-esteem and in return respect others.  Being 
honest gains trust and sometimes trust can be more valuable than money.  
Without communication, walls are built and eventually tumble down hurting 
everyone/everything surrounding them.  I really applaud your vision on 
communication.  Good communication is the main ingredient in every view of 
life.  Keep up the good work.  Striving for excellence encourages people to 
work hard, utilize their creative minds, explore new areas, and learn to 
adjust to change.  

Thank you again for allowing me to be a part of such a GREAT team.    "

"The 2000 Chairman's Award nomination process was a tremendous success!  From 
around the world, over 425 nominations were received representing a broad 
cross-section of our overall organization and resulting in a 73% increase in 
nomination participation from last year.  This 100% employee-driven program 
is so successful because you take time to nominate and recognize those 
individuals that are special in your work life.  Every single candidate is to 
be congratulated!  

This year, the original concept was brought to fruition when the members of 
the 1999 Chairman's Roundtable took over the selection process and carried 
the torch from past to present.  This Selection Committee reviewed all 
candidates on the basis of their ability to consistently bring our values to 
life and sought out those select few that are Enron's ""everyday heroes"".  

It is with great pleasure that we announce the 2000 Chairman's Roundtable 
whose daily pursuit of excellence, commitment to communication, genuine 
integrity and respect for others are what make Enron the incredible company 
that it is today - innovative, successful and undoubtedly one of the best 
places to work.  The eleven individuals named below are flying to San Antonio 
this from around the world to be honored at our annual Management 
Conference.  One of these finalist will receive the distinguished recognition 
as the actual Chairman's Award winner:

THE 2000 CHAIRMAN'S ROUNDTABLE

Amelia Alder, Enron Operations Services (ETS) - Houston, Texas
Dan Boyle, Enron Global Finance - Houston, Texas
Craig Buehler, Northern Natural Gas (ETS) - Houston, TX

Attached is a list of every employee who was nominated for the Chairman's 
Award this year:



Please take a moment to recognize this honor bestowed upon your fellow 
employees.  We sincerely thank them for their contributions to Enron and 
their leadership that helps make this organization the world,s leading energy 
and communications company.   If you have any questions regarding this year's 
program or suggestions for the future, please contact Charla Reese at

deal. His rational is that he thinks we will be ok on OWC in the final 
analysis. He did  say to reserve for the deal adequately and structure it as 
appropriate for the circumstances. He also wanted to know if there is 
anything different here than on OWC. I told him that it wasn't significantly 
different (both strong underlying businesses with huge event risk attached)

Attached for review and comment is a draft set of talking points on the Barton RTO discussion draft.  I went through the testimony at the recent hearing and parsed the legislative language of the discussion draft.  You will see that the talking points are designed to respond to two basic points being raised by our opponents: (1) that FERC is rushing and being heavy-handed and (2) that the only interests involved are those of the transmitting utilities (i.e., no mention of discrimination as being what RTOs will remedy).

Please let me have your thoughts in the next few days.  Once Capitol Hill is up and running again, we will distribute the final talking points to our consultants and to members/staff of the Barton Subcommittee as we continue our efforts against the discussion draft's treatment of RTOs.

Jeff:

I have looked at the products that initially will be traded on EOL in 
Argentina.  

As stated in the summary, the Argentine Power financial swap transaction will 
be enterred into by Enron North America Corp.  The documentation should 
indicate that only non-Argentine counterparties will be allowed to enter into 
this type of transaction.

The Argentine Power Physical Firm transaction should be changed to show that 
the Enron entity enterring into the transaction will be Enron 
Comercializadora Energia Argentina.  The counterparties will be Argentine 
companies.

The third category of power contract does not make sense to me.  It is 
described as a physical trade but is a US transaction.  This does not make 
sense in light of the business conducted in Argentina.  Perhaps you can 
provide an explanation of this transaction for me.


The Enron party and the counterparties for the Argentine Gas Physical 
transaction is correctly stated in the summary.

Subject: ARG Power and Gas

Scott,

Here are the legal descriptions that we crafted based on information provided 
to us by Argentina; they are not in final form b/c they haven't been 
signed-off on by Legal. 

  

Things are generally sketchy when they come in from ARG, and the lawyer that 
I am working with here in Houston is concerned about he website content. 
Additionally, you are right that we should probably expect the number of 
Products to build, but at this point, the Product Types are:

ARG Gas Phy Fwd (trading book system set to SITARA); for delivery at
 Aldea Brasilera
 Bahia Blanca
 Buenos Aires
 BuenosAires Sur
 Centro-Cordoba
 CentroCatamarca
 Chubut
 Cuyana-Mendoza
 Cuyana-San Luis
 Cuyana-San Juan
 GBA (TGN)
 GBA (TGS)
 Litoral-ProStFe
 Litoral-Prov-BA
 Neuquen (TGN)
 Neuguen (TGS)
 Noroeste
 Norte-Salta
 Norte-Tucuman 
 Santa Cruz
 Tierra delFuego

It is my understanding that these are more delivery zones than they are 
delivery points, and each zone has a few meters that gas can be delivered to 
with no affect on pricing. We are suggesting to ARG that we use something 
like the WAHA language, where Buyer has the right to desinate the meter at 
scheduling. I'll keep you up to speed on this as it develops.

ARG Power Financial Swap (trading book system set to SPREADSHEET)
 traded on the Index EZE Flat

ARG Power Phy Index 
 traded on the Index Cam EZE Flat

ARG Power Phy Fwd

This is what we have to date. Please let me know if this is sufficient 
information to get you started, or if you need more, I'm glad to help. If you 
think access to TEST is the best route, let me or Jenn know and we'll try to 
get the ball rolling.

RAC - can you provide Sigma Factors, please.

CREDIT and TAX - for your review and consideration.

_____________________________________________________________________

The STOCK INDEXES The Nasdaq and S&P's closed lower on Wednesday as
chip and hardware stocks fell due to concerns over corporate profits.
Salomon Smith Barney lowered its rating on the chip equipment group,
citing a capital-spending freeze of up to six months at Intel. The
Dow closed higher on Wednesday due in part to strength in Philip
Morris, J.P. Morgan and Johnson & Johnson. Early strength tested last
week's high crossing at 10,917.30, which marks short-term resistance.
Multiple closes above this resistance level would open the door for a
possible year end rally that could lead to an eventual test of last
spring's high crossing at 11,425.40 later this winter.

INTEREST RATES March bonds gapped up and surged to a new contract
high thereby renewing this fall's rally. Weakness in the Nasdaq and
S&P's underpinned today's rally in bonds in part due to a safe-haven
move by some investors. Today's high-range close sets the stage for
sharply higher prices on Thursday should November's Producer Price
Index come in weaker than expected. If the rally in March bonds
continues, weekly resistance crossing at 106-10 is the next upside
objective later this winter.

CRB INDEX extended Tuesday's loss and confirmed a downside breakout
below the lower boundary of this month's symmetrical triangle and
filled November's gap at 227.58. Today's decline confirms the rally
off the late-October low has come to an end while marking a broad
double top on the daily chart. If the decline continues, fib support
crossing at 225.87 is the next downside target. Much of today's
pressure was due to weakness in precious metals, foods, fiber, and
energies.

ENERGIES The energy markets closed sharply lower on Wednesday due to
liquidation of Brent crude oil ahead of Thursday's January contract
expiration. The sell off was some what of a surprise following recent
industry data, which showed crude and heating oil stocks fell last
week and indications that Iraq has not fully resumed crude oil sales.
February crude oil posted a key reversal down today thereby ending
this week's short covering rebound. Additional weakness on Thursday
is needed to confirm today's reversal pattern. If this fall's decline
resumes, fib support crossing at 27.37 is the next target. February
heating oil also closed sharply lower on Wednesday and is challenging
key support crossing at 88.10. Multiple closes below this support
level could lead to a test of the 38% retracement level of the
1999/2000- advance crossing at 84.11 later this winter.

CURRENCIES the March Dollar closed higher on Wednesday as it renewed
its short covering rebound off last week's low. Today's rally was
underpinned by Tuesday's U.S. Supreme Court decision to halt the
manual recount thereby giving the election to George W. Bush.
Momentum indicators have turned bullish signaling sideways to higher
prices into the end of the year are possible. Today's mid-range close
leaves the door open for sideways trading on Thursday. The March
Swiss Franc and D-mark closed lower on Wednesday as they extend their
declines off last week's highs. Momentum indicators have turned
bearish warning additional weakness into the end of the year is
possible. The March Japanese Yen plunged to a new contract low in
overnight trading and held onto those losses during the day session.
Concerns over the Japanese economy and the U.S. Supreme Court ruling
triggered the sell off. The door is open for a test of last
February's low crossing at .8978 then fib support crossing at .8774
later this winter.

PRECIOUS METALS were closed lower on Wednesday. February gold resumed
its decline off last week's high and closed below November's uptrend
line crossing near 271.80 thereby confirming a short-term top has
been posted. Momentum indicators are bearish signaling sideways to
lower prices into the end of the year are possible. Support begins at
266.80. March silver also closed lower on Wednesday ending this
week's short covering bounce. Today's new low close for the week and
test of support crossing at 4.69 sets the stage for additional
weakness into the end of the year. If the decline continues, weekly
support crossing at 4.56 cents is March's next target. March copper
extended Tuesday's loss in relatively narrow trading but pulled up
short of testing November's uptrend line crossing near 87.75. A short
covering bounce ahead of the close tempered some of today's losses
leaving the door open for additional short covering on Thursday.
Nevertheless, momentum indicators are overbought and turning bearish
signaling additional weakness near-term is possible. Closes below
November's uptrend line would confirm a top and trend change has
taken place.

GRAINS closed mixed on Wednesday. March corn posted a key reversal up
Wednesday due to expectations that tomorrow's export sales report
will show a significant improvement from recent weeks. Confirmation
of improving export sales on Thursday could lead to further short
covering thereby turning a number of momentum indicators neutral to
bullish. Such a turnaround in the near-term price outlook could lead
to year-end rebound however, it will take closes above 2.22 1/4
before a low is confirmed. March wheat closed lower on Wednesday as
traders are struggling to find direction following Tuesday's key
reversal down in the face of a friendly supply and demand report.
Traders remain concerned over lagging export sales and expect to see
another week of slow export sales in Thursday's report. March is
challenging trading range support crossing at 2.69. If this support
level is broken, the fall low at 2.63 1/2 then long-term support at
2.50 are possible targets. Momentum indicators are bearish signaling
additional weakness is possible.

SOYBEAN COMPLEX closed mixed on Wednesday. March beans managed to
squeak out a fractional gain on Wednesday as it continues to
consolidate below the 75% retracement level of this fall's decline,
which crosses at 5.20. While Tuesday's supply and demand report was
friendly, the increase in export sales and drop in carryout was
already factored into prices. March beans are at a crossroads as a
lack of fresh news is limiting gains while solid demand continues to
underpin the market. Closes above 5.20 or below trendline support
crossing near 5.12 are needed to clear up near-term direction in the
market. March soybean meal closed slightly lower on Wednesday due to
light profit taking as it consolidated some of its recent gains.
March continues to extend the late-fall trading range despite
Tuesday's friendly supply and demand report. Closes above 189.50 or
below 182.30 are needed to clear up near-term direction in the
market. March bean oil posted an inside day with a slightly higher
close due to light short covering as it consolidated some of this
week's losses. However, today's low-range close leaves the door open
for a resumption of the decline off this month's high. Momentum
indicators are bearish signaling a test of November's low crossing at
15.05 is possible later this winter.

LIVESTOCK closed steady on Wednesday. February hogs posted a quiet
inside day with a steady close as it consolidated some of Tuesday's
loss. However, momentum indicators are diverging and turning bearish
warning traders that a broad double top may have been posted with
Monday's spike high. A resumption of this week's decline on Thursday
would set the stage for a test of trendline support crossing near
57.50. If the late fall rally resumes, weekly resistance crossing at
63.30 is the next upside target. February cattle also closed steady
after early strength tied to winter storm concerns and expectations
for higher cash bids gave way to light profit taking ahead of the
close. Today's high fell short of testing weekly resistance crossing
at 77.92. Momentum indicators have become very overbought warning
traders that much of the bullish news from higher cash and product
prices underpinned by surprisingly strong demand may have already
been discounted in prices. Closes below Tuesday's low at 76.50 would
be a clear warning to bulls that a short-term top may be in or near.

FOOD & FIBER markets were mixed on Thursday. March coffee posted
another quiet inside day with its lowest close ever while May fell
within 20 cents of the contract low. Forecast for rain across
Brazil's coffee growing region this weekend combined with last week's
bearish world crop estimate continues to weigh on prices. March cocoa
gave us the short covering bounce we were looking for following
Tuesday's high-range close. Additional short covering is possible
however, upside potential appears limited in the face of continued
origin selling that may last into the end of the year. March sugar
finally resumed its decline off November's high after drifting
sideways for the past week and a half. Renewed fund and speculator
selling due to a lack of cash trade activity triggered today's plunge
to new lows. Momentum indicators are bearish signaling sideways to
lower prices are possible. If the decline continues 930, then 867 are
the next targets. March cotton extended Tuesday's trendline breakout
thereby confirming this week's gap marked a downside breakaway gap.
Today's loss sets the stage for a likely test of October's low
crossing at 63.75 cents later this winter. Bearish fallout from
Tuesday's negative supply and demand report continues to weigh on
prices. I would not be surprised to see a short covering bounce on
Thursday especially if export sales come in above pre-report
expectations.

"EnronOnline/NetCoOnline status update:

- ""NetCoOnline"" will be distinct from EnronOnline, with much the same functionality and a refreshed look.

- We will carry data to support the same gas and power products as were on EnronOnline. Please contact us if you will need different products from what was on EnronOnline.

- We have prepared a list of top customers in CDN and US Gas and Power (copy attached), which we will be using as a guide in chasing signed Password Applications.

- To speed the registration process, top customers will be preloaded into the system for activation as soon as we receive their Password Application. 

- We are intending to use a simple, online GTC, which can be superceded by a negotiated Master Agreement, as with EnronOnline.

- Internal trader names have been circulated to each desk head for approval.

Subject:	Re-start/Integration Planning

We have for the last couple of weeks started to compile the Re-start/Integration Plans for Netco.  So far, we have primarily focussed on the mid/back plans where the technology requirements have been the driving factors.  Several plans are in the final stages of completion including:-

+	Infrastructure		Jenny Rub
+	Development		Jay Webb
+	EnronOnline		Webb / Forster
+	HR			David Oxley
+	Cash Management	Tom Myers
+	Credit			Debbie Brackett

The rest will be completed shortly.

We now need to focus on the commercial plans which have a slightly different focus. John and I would like to receive the plans ""Re-start/Integration""  plans by January 7th, 2002 in order to go through them individually with each of you or in groups.  The focus should be to ensure that we have as much of the business up and running in the shortest time possible.  I have a suggested outline which you do not have to use but I thought it might help.  Please decide within yourselves the areas you will cover together or individually.

				Phase  2 - First Month (eg top 50)
				Phase  3 - First Quarter (eg top 100)
+	Action Plan		Phase  1 Customers
				Phase  2 Customers
				Phase  3 Customers

Subject:	Electricity purchase for Co-op

Hi John,

We have determined that there was a small portion of power that was underhedged for Co-op. Lori Poffenroth has asked me to purchase this to balance our exposure.

EDC buys from ECC:

Quantity: 0.05823 MW
Flat block 7x24 financial fixed price
Start date: July 20, 2001 (or as early as possible), HE 1:00 (MPT)
End date: December 31, 2005 HE 24:00 (MPT) 

Please advise me of Price and Start Date.

Thanks. Mark. "
"Attached below please find the cash flow/tariff increase study we discussed 2 
1/2 weeks ago at the Sunday DPC strategy session.  The study assumes a 
decrease in losses from 40% to 25% and an increase in collection efficiency 
83% to 92% from 2000-01 to 2006-07.  Further, it is assumed that only one 
block of DPC operates until 2006-07.  

Two scenarios based on average realisation are illustrated:

1. A realistic cash flow study and  accompanying tariffs.  Given the above 
assumptions and assuming there is no state subsidy in 2006-07, MSEB should 
have a cash flow deficit of R34 Cr. in 2006-07 when Phase II comes on line 
for sale to MSEB, given a reasonable annual tariff increase.  (See the tariff 
sheet in gray shaded area.)  The annual rate increases would be15% for LT and 
HT agriculture and LT public water works, a 10% increase for domestic, street 
lights and interstate sales, a 4% increase for LT industrial and powerloom, 
and 1% increase for LT commercial and HT industrial, public water works and 
railways.

2. The annual tariff increases needed for MSEB to break even with a 3% 
profit, assuming industrial and commercial classes are held flat, are 
detailed below.  (See the Tariff sheet in red.) 
 
 Domestic          8%
 LT Public Water Works    35.60% 
 LT Agriculture and Poultry   26% 
 Street Light     10.8%
 HT Agricultural & Poultry    26.9%
 Mula Pravara Electric Coop Soc.  24.30% 
 Interstate sales       6.5%

It is obvious that  even the more realistic scenario would require strong 
MSEB, state government and regulator resolve.

In a separate e:mail I will describe the cost of service study we have also 
developed for MSEB.

Jane,

Attached is the latest summary (hard coded numbers, like I sent before) and 
the latest cashflow model in case that is required for anything.

Just to confirm all that has changed are the customer categories and the MU's 
in 1999-2000.

HEADLINE: Amid giant redwoods, Bush stumps for 'new environmentalism'

BYLINE: Bill Ainsworth

DATELINE: SEQUOIA NATIONAL PARK, Calif.

BODY:

??President Bush yesterday chose one of the oldest living trees an ancient
sequoia as a backdrop to declare ''a new environmentalism for the 21st 
century''
that balances protection of natural treasures with private property rights.

??Dressed in casual clothes and a green windbreaker, Bush used the spectacular
setting to highlight his plan to spend $5 billion over five years to reduce 
the
national parks' huge maintenance backlog.

??He spoke in reverent tones about the responsibility of the government to
preserve areas such as the sequoia groves of the high Sierra.

??''Our duty is to use the lands well and sometimes not to use them at all,''
Bush said, standing in front of the Sentinel, a 2,200-year-old tree that soars
257 feet and measures 86 feet around.

??Yet Bush said such decisions must not ignore private property rights.

??''We must protect the claims of nature, while also protecting the legal
rights of property owners,'' Bush said.

??He added that state and local governments also have responsibility for the
environment.

??''And usually they have a better grasp of the problem and what is needed to
solve it,'' Bush said. ''Washington has sometimes relied too much on threat 
and
mandate from afar, when it should be encouraging innovation and high standards
from the people closest to the land.''

??Environmental groups have criticized Bush on a number of fronts, from 
seeking
to open public lands to oil and gas exploration to dropping new restrictions 
on
arsenic in drinking water to his broken campaign promise to regulate carbon
dioxide emissions.

??At least one organization, the National Parks Conservation Organization, 
took
issue with the plan Bush announced yesterday because it included virtually no
money for new parkland and instead focused on building roads and buildings.

??The Sierra Club suggested that Bush was in no position to claim the mantle 
of
environmentalist.

??Polls show the public is leery of the president on the environment, and
yesterday's event was one in a series aimed at bolstering his credentials in
that area.

??The day before, his administration affirmed a plan put into place in the
latter days of the Clinton administration to reduce haze at national parks. 
The
Clinton rules, initially put on hold by Bush, help states force older power
plants and industrial facilities to cut air pollution.

??Democrats believe the president, who lost California by 12 percent of the
vote, is vulnerable on environment and energy issues. Tuesday, he met with 
Gov.
Gray Davis to discuss the energy crisis, a meeting that resulted in the 
expected
disagreement over wholesale electricity price caps Davis wants and Bush does
not.

??Yesterday, energy was not on the president's agenda. He refused to answer
questions from reporters; the general public was not allowed to attend any of
his three events during his two-day California visit, which included a speech
Tuesday at Camp Pendleton.

??Yesterday, his speech took on a philosophic tone about balancing competing
interests.

??''My administration will adopt a new spirit of respect and cooperation,
because, in the end, that is the better way to protect the environment we all
share a new environmentalism for the 21st century,'' Bush said, in a carefully
choreographed setting with park rangers in front of the giant sequoia.

??The president pushed his National Parks Legacy Project, a plan proposed
during his campaign to spend $5 billion on the needs of parks, including
improving neglected buildings and roads.

??As part of the plan, he wants to protect 4,000 miles of rivers, restore 
9,000
acres of parklands to their natural habitat and double the money for studying
wildlife resources in parks.

??Bush was joined by Interior Secretary Gale Norton, whom he asked to produce
annual reports on each national park.

??''Good stewardship begins here,'' Bush said. ''... Yet many parks have gone
years without receiving the kind of care and upkeep the American people
expect.''

??Bush said Sequoia National Park is doing what he'd like all parks to do:
serve visitors better.

??The park is adding miles of trails, tearing down buildings that threaten the
roots of the giant trees and building a museum that can teach more visitors
about the unique trees.

??''Sequoia is a model,'' he said. ''Allowing for more visitors without
destroying the very things that draw people here the scenery, the quiet, the
animals left unharmed in their natural habitat.''

??But the National Parks Conservation Association, a watchdog group, 
criticized
Bush's overall park policy, giving the new president a grade of ''D.''

??Bush's energy plan, the group said, will actually worsen air quality in many
parks because he wants to weaken the Clean Air Act and he has rejected efforts
to tackle global warming.

??''His unwillingness to address global climate change spells disaster for 
many
of our parks,'' the group's report said. ''If he moves to drill for oil and 
gas
in national monuments, serious resource degradation is all but guaranteed.''

??The group supports his effort to spend more money on parks, but said his 
plan
is ''a bit of a shell game'' because it includes just $61 million this year in
new parks money. Ninety-eight percent of that is for roads and buildings, the
report said, which neglects nature and education.

HEADLINE: Legislators push for bill to allow sale of ""negawatts' to California

BYLINE: By Jim Landers

BODY:

??WASHINGTON _ Some Texas congressmen and energy companies are trying to help
California avert blackouts and utility price shocks this summer with a
market-based conservation strategy known as ""negawatts.""

??A ""demand auction"" would let power consumers earn money by selling
electricity they choose to conserve. It's aimed at big power users such as
industrial electric furnaces.

??If a California blackout appears likely and the state seeks more power in a
Western auction, these consumers could sell their willingness to conserve for
the same price an electric generator is selling supply.

??Utilities could then transfer the unused power on their systems to
California, pocket a fee and give the rest of the money to the conserving
customer.

??The demand auction concept was dubbed negawatts in the 1970s by Colorado
energy conservation guru Amory Lovins. By creating a marketplace that rewards
consumers for using less electricity, Lovins argued, negawatts (shorthand for
negative watts) reduce the need for power plants.

??The Texas effort, led by state Rep. Joe Barton, unites generating and
marketing companies such as Reliant Energy Inc. and Enron Corp., who some
California critics call the ""Houston pirates,"" in a sweeping conservation
program.

??Backers say a demand auction could reduce blackouts by making more power
available from consumers who choose to conserve for a price.

??Municipally owned utilities and cooperatives have led the opposition to the
proposal by arguing that it lets consumers treat electricity as a property 
right
rather than a service.

??""It sets up a whole new class of customers with a legal entitlement to power
they don't consume,"" said Joe Nipper, senior vice president of the American
Public Power Association. ""What you need is yours to consume, but unless you
have a contract beyond that, it's not yours. This may be a federal taking of a
utility's property.""

??The approach is appealing to conservatives such as Barton and Rep. Ralph 
Hall
because it deepens the nation's experiment in electricity deregulation at a 
time
when many California Democrats want to abandon it for price controls.

??Enron executive vice president Steven Kean backed the negawatts idea in
congressional testimony in January.

??""New capacity cannot be brought on in time for this summer's peaks,"" he 
said.
""But demand reductions could be purchased with a minimum of disruption to
businesses, workers and the economy.""

??The incentives can be substantial. Residential retail electricity prices in
California normally average around 10 cents per kilowatt-hour. Spot-market
wholesale prices have soared as high as $1.90 per kilowatt-hour.

??A consumer who agreed to stop consumption for an hour to sell that power
could realize $1.80 from a bidding California utility, and still pay the 10
cents to his or her own electricity provider.

??""Every customer should want this type of service in the marketplace, because
it will bring prices down,"" said John Hughes of the Electricity Consumers
Resource Council, a national organization of industrial and commercial power
users.

??Reliant Energy, which has been vilified by California Gov. Gray Davis and
other California Democrats for its high-priced electricity, bought full-page 
ads
in four national newspapers last week to promote negawatts.

??Barton said his Electric Emergency Relief Act, including a nationwide
negawatts market, was the only legislation advancing through Congress that 
has a
chance of helping California this summer.

??Despite the concerns of some utilities, the idea has won bipartisan support.

??Barton gives it only a ""modest chance"" of success, however, because it is
part of legislation many Democrats are seeking to amend by imposing 
electricity
price caps and returning regulation to the California power market.

??""It puts us between a real rock and a hard place,"" Barton said. ""The
president is never going to sign a bill that has price caps. But if the
government of California just says, 'Price caps, price caps, price caps,' you
put their members of Congress in the position where if they don't deliver 
price
caps, they don't deliver anything.""

??If Barton's California relief bill stalls, however, the national negawatts
market idea will probably surface in Congress again this year. Bush's national
energy plan urges Congress to restructure the electricity industry nationwide
along market-based principles.

??""That's kind of where I am, isn't it?"" said Barton, who chairs the House
energy and air quality subcommittee.

??Reliant Energy senior vice president John Stout said that without the Barton
bill, California will plummet into an emergency situation this summer where
those in charge will reach for the negawatts concept for fast relief.

??""They will say we got to do something to keep the lights on, now, and 
they'll
reach for this,"" he said.

??Negawatt markets already exist in several parts of the country, including
California. An Internet auction known as the Demand Exchange was established
with the approval of the California Energy Commission in hopes of reducing
consumption this summer by less than 1 percent.

??Test negawatt auctions began in 1999 in Connecticut and Georgia, and more
than a dozen utility exchanges were in existence last year.

??Utilities have long offered rate incentives for customers willing to have
their electricity supplies interrupted at times of peak demand.

??A negawatts auction is popular with big consumers because it lets them 
decide
when they want to forego electricity, Hughes said.

??""There is a clear and compelling need to establish a mechanism for allowing
negawatts of emergency supply to be easily purchased in the same way as
megawatts of additional supply,"" Stout said. ""This would enable a deficit area
such as California to purchase emergency supply from anywhere within the 
West.""

??Several aluminum smelters in the Pacific Northwest have shut down in the 
last
year in order to sell electricity for more profit than they could sell 
aluminum.
The smelters hold power contracts with the federal Bonneville Power
Administration that contain clauses allowing them to market the electricity.

??Those were contracted arrangements between Bonneville and its customers,
Nipper said. Barton's negawatts arrangement would throw the market open to
virtually all electricity users, and let companies such as Enron profit from
handling the transactions.

??""This would let these companies do these deals and get their commission on
it,"" Nipper said. ""Utilities and their customers can do those deals now 
without
any commissions.""

HEADLINE: With energy crisis on nation's collective mind, Abraham faces test 
of
his life

BYLINE: By Ruby L. Bailey

BODY:

??WASHINGTON _ There was a moment during dinner with President Bush when
Spencer Abraham couldn't believe his luck.

??As Abraham tells it, it was a recent Thursday night. He, Bush and
Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Christine Todd Whitman were on 
Air
Force One on a return trip to Washington from Iowa. The former one-term U.S.
senator from Michigan felt a long way from his crushing re-election defeat in
November.

??""People were sending me condolences back then,"" Abraham said. ""You sort of
have to pinch yourself.""

??The moment of elation was fleeting. At 7 a.m. the next morning, Abraham 
began
touring the country to promote _ and defend _ the controversial energy policy 
he
helped create as a member of Vice President Dick Cheney's Energy Policy
Development Task Force.

??Even before its release, the plan _ which supports drilling in Alaska's
Arctic Natural Wildlife Refuge and building more refineries _ faced fierce
opposition from Democrats and environmentalists who want more emphasis on
conservation and immediate relief for consumers.

??""Someone in the department told me, 'It's a good thing you've got a good
sense of humor,'"" aid Abraham, who is the scheduled luncheon speaker Friday on
Mackinac Island at the Detroit Regional Chamber's 21st annual Leadership 
Policy
Conference.

??His sense of humor has come in handy, he said, since taking the helm of the
bedeviled Department of Energy and becoming the point man in the middle of a
national energy crisis.

??He has hoped for rain in the drought-stricken Pacific Northwest to power
hydrogenerators, but the region remains dry.

??He has been barraged with complaints from Michigan and other Midwestern
states where gasoline prices are skyrocketing.

??He has called for conservation to curb blackouts in California _ but the
state faces a summer of more blackouts than ever before.

??New Yorkers haven't weighed in yet _ but Abraham is sure he'll hear from
them, too, because New York City is facing possible power outages this summer.

??""We can't create new generating machines for them,"" Abraham said, only
half-joking, in an interview last week. ""We don't have a big generator in the
basement that I can turn on and point towards California.""

??The problem with politics, he said, is that ""people always expect instant
solutions. We have long days here.""

??His days have been long since January when the Washington rumor mill said he
was being considered for transportation secretary. Even his critics would not
have been surprised if Bush had tapped him for that job. In 1983, he chaired 
the
Michigan Republican Party.

??In 1989, he became deputy chief of staff to Vice President Dan Quayle.
Elected to the U.S. Senate in 1994, he was involved in transportation issues 
and
helped Michigan get millions of dollars in highway funding.

??But his nomination to head the Department of Energy surprised many _ and
outraged environmentalists. As a senator, Abraham was conservative and firmly
pro-business. Environmental groups graded him lax on pollution and 
conservation.

??His critics pointed out that during his Senate term, he had pushed to
eliminate the very department he was now being tapped to head. At the time, he
said, the department was ""redundant,"" duplicating the work of other 
departments.

??""It was surprising, given his position as far as abolishing the Energy
Department,"" said Tanya Calaba, land and water conservation coordinator for 
the
Lake Michigan Federation in Traverse City, which opposes drilling for oil and
natural gas in the Great Lakes. ""I don't know what expertise he brings.""

??But Abraham contributed heavily to Cheney's task force meetings, said Mary
Matalin, an adviser to Bush and Cheney. The group met 28 times in 14 weeks.
Abraham attended nearly every meeting, between trips to California to deal 
with
the rolling blackouts.

??""He was, in every presentation to the president and every task force 
meeting,
a key player,"" Matalin said. ""There wasn't an issue on the table that Spence 
did
not have an articulation on.""

??Even Abraham's supporters don't claim that he had a major hand in writing 
the
energy plan. His job, they say, has been as adviser and point man.

??""His role has been largely providing support to the Cheney task force and to
make certain some new ideas get implemented,"" said Robert Walker, chairman and
chief executive officer of the Wexler Group in Washington. The company lobbies
for BP (formerly British Petroleum) and other energy industry clients.

??Despite his lack of background on energy issues, friends and adversaries say
Abraham has stepped up to the job with his sharp intelligence and hard work. 
The
same traits served him well in the Senate, they say, where he never missed a
roll call vote in six years and passed more bills than any other senator in 
his
freshman class.

??""I think he has one of the best political and strategic minds that I've
seen,"" said Red Cavaney, president of the American Petroleum Institute, who 
has
known Abraham since his days as chairman of the Michigan Republican Party.

??""If he doesn't have a photographic mind, he's as close to having one as you
can get.""

??Abraham had just passed his confirmation hearings when Cavaney showed up at
his office with five petroleum CEOs.

??Sure that he was overwhelmed with his new position, the men offered their
congratulations, extended their assistance and asked for a follow-up meeting 
to
discuss the complicated world of refineries.

??But Abraham was ready to talk, Cavaney said.

??""It's extraordinarily complex. Here he was very fresh to the job, and he got
it,"" Cavaney said. ""He's very quickly able to grasp the context, to get into 
the
real nut of what the problems are.""

??At an Energy Department budget presentation in April, Abraham said the
department faced ""a truly extraordinary collection of difficult and pressing
issues.""

??The current problems ""are modest compared to what they could be in another
five years,"" he said.

??Rising demands for oil and gas are strapping tight supplies as the nation
also deals with an aging power infrastructure. The results: Natural gas bills 
in
Washington, D.C., have tripled. California predicts it could spend 260 hours
this summer in the dark.

??The Food and Agriculture Policy Institute, a Washington think tank, reports
that farmers are likely to see their incomes drop 20 percent during the next 
two
years because of high energy costs. In Michigan and other states, gasoline is
threatening to top $2.50 a gallon by summer.

??""He's in a hot spot,"" said Joseph Stanislaw, president of Cambridge Energy
Research Associates, an energy consulting firm in Washington. ""What's the
approach to the challenge? What balance does one strike?""

??That's yet to be determined. But one thing that everyone is predicting:
Abraham will clash with environmentalists on what to do about the nation's
emerging energy crisis.

??It won't be the first time. When Abraham was a senator, the Sierra Club, an
environmental protection organization, included him in its media campaign
against officials it contends don't protect the environment. It also opposed 
his
re-election, saying Abraham was in the pocket of the petroleum industry.

??Abraham's re-election campaign received $414,000 from the petroleum 
industry.
Bush received $2.8 million from the industry in his bid for the presidency.

??""He is energy-industry sympathetic and energy-industry friendly,"" said Lana
Pollack, president of the Michigan Environmental Council, a coalition of more
than 50 environmental agencies in Michigan.

??Pollack has known Abraham since 1994 when they both were running in primary
elections for the U.S. Senate. Pollack lost the Democratic primary. Abraham 
won
the GOP primary _ and the election.

??""He's never been a friend to the environment,"" said Daniel Becker, director
of global warming and energy for the Sierra Club.

??Not long after that Air Force One ride, gas prices shot up nearly 25 cents
overnight in Michigan.

??California Gov. Gray Davis announced that his state would sue the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission to force it to institute federal price controls 
on
California's rising electricity prices.

??Despite those problems, Abraham's sense of humor was firmly in place. He
recalled again that night aboard Air Force One, when he was pinching himself 
in
disbelief at his good fortune.

??""And people were sending me condolences because I lost the Senate,"" he
deadpanned.

FERC Chief Unfazed By Threat of Third Lawsuit

BYLINE: RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR, JUDY PASTERNAK, TIMES STAFF WRITERS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

BODY:

??The beleaguered chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said
Wednesday that he was not fazed by California Gov. Gray Davis' threat to sue 
the
agency for failing to cap wholesale electricity rates.

??California officials have gone to the federal courts twice before to force
FERC to impose price caps, Curt Hebert told reporters. And the U.S. 9th 
Circuit
Court of Appeals in San Francisco has twice rejected the suits.

??Davis, observing that FERC has a legal obligation to ensure that wholesale
electricity rates are ""just and reasonable,"" threatened to go to court again
after he failed in a meeting Tuesday to persuade President Bush to support 
caps
on wholesale electricity prices.

??""They've sued us two times and they have been [dismissed ] two times,"" 
Hebert
said. ""I feel very good about it.""

??Responding to reporters' questions, Hebert also appeared to be unaware of
media reports that President Bush had asked a rival for his chairmanship,
Patrick Wood III, to play a special role in dealing with California's 
problems.

??Wood, a Bush confidant who until now had been chairman of the Texas Public
Utility Commission, was confirmed by the Senate as a FERC commissioner last 
week
and is widely expected to be named to Hebert's job. The president can 
designate
any FERC commissioner as chairman without further action by the Senate.

??White House officials said during Bush's visit to Los Angeles on Tuesday 
that
Wood would follow up on concerns raised in the president's meeting with Davis.

??Wood said in an interview that he talked briefly with Davis three weeks ago
and more recently with California PUC President Loretta Lynch. He said his
charge is vague: to review the entire situation.

??""I'm looking at short-term things and long-term things,"" he said, noting 
that
he had heard from lawmakers ""on both sides of the aisle"" complaining that FERC
had not gone far enough.

??Wood, who advocates a more activist role for FERC, said he wants to monitor
how the agency's efforts to limit price spikes in California are working and
that he might push for changes. Unlike Hebert, he said the agency's standard 
for
deciding whether a company has market power--enough influence to sway
prices--needs to be reconsidered. He said he is also open to increasing the
amount of rebates ordered to utilities for January.

??And he said he thought FERC should also take another look at the design of
California's deregulated market. ""Your work never stops,"" Wood said. ""You 
never
get there and say, 'We're done.' ""

??California, he added, ""is salvageable,"" though he said blackouts are
inevitable this summer.

??FERC itself has acknowledged that California is paying unfair prices for
electricity, particularly during power shortages. But instead of imposing 
price
caps, the agency has instituted a complex system to monitor the market and 
seek
refunds from power sellers that overcharge during emergencies.
??A majority of FERC's governing board believes that price caps would deter
investors from building new power plants in California, thereby complicating
efforts to increase energy supplies. Price caps ""would destroy what is left of
California,"" Hebert said Wednesday.

??State officials disagree.

??With California paying as much as $1,900 per megawatt hour to avert 
blackouts
earlier this month--five times the current market price--state officials argue
that FERC's approach is no deterrent and that the agency has a legal 
obligation
to impose price caps.

??Davis and others contend that temporary controls would bring order to the
power markets and prevent further damage to California's economy. They point 
out
that the energy industry operated efficiently under government-set rates until
the recent onset of deregulation. 

??But the courts have held that FERC has wide latitude in fulfilling its
obligations under federal law.

??In an April 11 decision denying a petition for relief by the city of San
Diego, a 9th Circuit panel ruled that the same law that gives FERC authority 
to
impose price caps also allows it to pursue alternatives.

??On Tuesday, the same court dismissed a petition from state Senate leader 
John
Burton, citing its earlier decision in the San Diego case.

HEADLINE: Bush, Davis Clash on Energy Price Caps

BODY:

??I am disappointed that President Bush and Gov. Gray Davis could not agree on
short-term price caps for electrical rates in California during their May 29
meeting. As a businessman and resident of California, I support the 
free-market
system; however, the demand for electricity is no higher now than a year ago.
The supply of electricity is no smaller than a year ago. The only thing that 
has
changed is the system that is used for setting prices.

??Businesses in California deserve a break from the crippling increase in
prices. Working moms and dads should not be asked to subsidize power 
executives
in other states. The federal government owes the working people and businesses
of California a chance to sort out the mess imposed upon us. We deserve a
short-term cap on prices.

??Steve Graves

??Highland

??*

??Bush is correct to say that electricity price caps will not change either 
the
supply or the demand. But he is wrong to allow the greed and price-gouging of
the energy suppliers. Greed and gouging are not parts of compassionate
capitalism.

??Porter Ewing

??Van Nuys

??*

??Davis has done nothing toward solving the energy crisis over the past year
and a half. He has overwhelming party majorities in both the Assembly and 
Senate
and yet has passed no meaningful legislation regarding energy. Furthermore,
California voted against President Bush by a 2-1 margin in the recent
presidential election. Despite this, all we hear from the governor is,
""President Bush, federal government, save us! We need price controls.""

??Governor, instead of crying to the federal government for help, provide
leadership for solving a California problem. California created the problem, 
not
the federal government. It is our responsibility to solve our problems. There 
is
nothing stopping you from enacting meaningful solutions to the energy crisis
except your own indecisiveness.

??John Anagnost

??Torrance

??*

??Hurray for Davis! Finally he's going to do something: Sue the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission for relief from the gougers. Our ""compassionate""
president, who thumbed his nose at California, is certainly not going to do
anything to help us, like capping the prices. He's only interested in his big
business and oil friends in Texas making even more money.

??Ann and Dale Johnston

??Thousand Oaks

??*

??Perhaps if Intel (headquartered in Santa Clara) and Advanced Micro Devices
(headquartered in Sunnyvale) charged Dell (headquartered in Round Rock, Texas)
and Compaq (headquartered in Houston) 50 times more for their chips than they
charged Gateway (headquartered in San Diego), Bush might realize that there is
something he can do about extortion.

??Arnie Pierce

??Shingle Springs, Calif.

??*

??In ""Governor to Stress Price Caps to Bush"" (May 29), Davis is quoted as
saying, ""The marketplace is not working."" I am curious as to how he knows 
that,
when the consumption side of the market has had price caps on it from the very
beginning. If those caps have created the price extremes and supply shortages
that we have seen, just wait until you see both ends of the market with price
caps.

Bush Blunders Into Equal Footing With Davis

BYLINE: GEORGE SKELTON

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO

BODY:

??When the president holds a ""summit"" with a governor, you can figure one of
three things: this president--politically--is weak, desperate or inept.

??With President Bush, we've just seen indications of all three.

??Presidents of the United States simply do not hold summits with 
governors--of
any state. Presidents hold summits with leaders of equal stature: other heads 
of
state or prime ministers.

??A governor is not a head of state.

??Sacramento is not a little Washington. It's a big Carson City.

??Ronald Reagan never held a summit with Jerry Brown. Bill Clinton barely
acknowledged the existence of Pete Wilson.

??So why would this Republican president fly across country to elevate a
Democratic governor to the exalted level of summitry? Must be that Bush has
looked at private polls and seen he is weaker in California than he'd ever
imagined possible, even after losing here last November by 12 points.

??Indeed, the independent Field Poll recently found that 54% of Californians
think Bush has done a ""poor"" job of trying to improve the state's energy mess.

??It's desperation time. Better get out to California and show that he does 
too
care about the nation's most populous state before it's too late--before the
damage is irreparable. Before he's a liability to Republican members of
Congress, whose reelections next year will be crucial to the GOP's continued
control of the U.S. House.

??And better make that first trip to California about public policy--not about
political fund-raising.

??But the president could have--should have--avoided what the news media would
characterize as a summit. On the governor's L.A. turf, no less. This was
political ineptitude.

??Weeks ago, Bush could have invited Gov. Gray Davis into the Oval Office for 
a
chat. Then he could have dismissed any later calls for a second meeting, 
saying
there was nothing new to discuss.

??Or Bush could have sent his energy guru, Vice President Dick Cheney, to meet
with Davis. Then there wouldn't have been the summit circus that elevated a
governor, in news coverage, to the level of a president.

??But Bush set his own trap by declaring, even before taking office, that
California was on its own. He ignored the state for four months, then was 
goaded
into a summit.

??""We outfoxed them,"" says Paul Maslin, Davis' pollster. ""We turned up the 
heat
and made it politically impossible for Bush not to meet.""

??Consequently, there was the specter of a governor's ""post-summit"" news
conference being carried live on CNN. And split screens with Bush on one side,
Davis on the other, both waving presidential-like. Davis sit-down interviews
with all networks. The story at the top of the nightly news.

??One national TV reporter spoke ominously of a ""rift"" between the governor 
and
the president. A newspaper banner screamed: ""Bush-Davis Standoff.""

??Presidents simply do not have standoffs with governors who are poking them 
in
the eye.

??However, it was Bush to the rescue--not of energy consumers, but the
governor. Davis remains one lucky politician. Here he is, foundering in the
polls--his job rating down to 42%, according to Field--and the president rides
out to save him.

??Bush helped Davis onto a tall platform and handed him a loud mike to make 
his
pitch to California voters. The governor made it over and over:

??This is not about the philosophy of price controls. It's about federal
regulators ignoring a law that requires wholesale prices to be ""just and
reasonable."" Enforcing that law is solely a federal responsibility.

??I'm doing everything I can to increase supply. The president needs to rein 
in
his buddies--those gougers and market gamers from Texas.

??""This is no time for harsh rhetoric,"" Bush said. ""It's certainly no time for
name-calling.""

??The president's certainly wrong. It's time to call out and embarrass--if
possible--the power pirates who are turning 700% profits. Take 40% and be
satisfied. Spare us a recession.

??""Price caps may sound appealing,"" Bush asserted, ""but their result will
ultimately be more serious shortages and therefore even higher prices.""

??Wrong again. California didn't suffer supply-caused blackouts until the Feds
lifted wholesale price caps last December and power producers began gaming the
market to finesse top dollar. In fact, most power plants now being built in
California began under price caps.

??Bush likes to hearken back 30 years to failed price controls under Richard
Nixon. But if Nixon's mind had been as inflexible as Bush's, he never would 
have
gone to China.

??Now that was a summit.

HEADLINE: See How You Like This Action, Mr. President

BYLINE: PETER H. KING

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO

BODY:

??And so the president of the United States made his way to California this
week and offered some advice. What Californians need to do, President Bush 
said,
is quit whining about the energy mess and take action: ""Energy,"" he said, ""is 
a
problem that requires action, not politics, not excuses, but action.""

??Issuing $12.5 billion in bonds, pushing a dozen or so new power plants
through the pipeline, launching a World War II-style conservation
campaign--apparently these don't qualify as action. And asking federal 
so-called
regulators to step forward and bring some order to a deregulated wholesale
market run amok--well, apparently, that would fall under the heading of
""excuses.""

??And excuses won't do. No, sir. Action is the answer. Now just what action 
the
president believes Californians should take he did not make clear. At this
point, however, there seems to be about only one course left untried--seizing
power plants. Now there's action.

??It's fun just to imagine the potential theatrics. National Guard troops
swarming the gates, while plant operators, screaming strange Texas curses,
frantically shred the maintenance records. And, look, there goes Gray Davis
himself, shinnying up a smokestack to unfurl the bear flag, shouting ""Eureka! 
We
have seized it!""

??Alas, however glorious such imagery, this is not how it would work. The most
persistent proponent of plant seizure option has been state Treasurer Phil
Angelides, and in an interview he described an almost bland procedure: a paper
battle that ultimately would engage, as he put it, ""fleets of lawyers and
accountants.""

??Before he delved into specifics, Angelides, a Democrat and former land
developer, paused to make the historical case for taking public action to rein
in runaway private markets and protect common interests. He spoke of Teddy
Roosevelt and the trustbusters, of the federal response to the Great 
Depression,
of the long history of regulated power utilities, and also of zoning laws and
the not uncommon instances of eminent-domain property seizures for roadways 
and
schools.

??""The notion of a society and economy protecting itself through public action
against a private market gone awry,"" Angelides said, ""or through the 
acquisition
of private property in the public interest, is not a novel one, a radical one,
or one that is inconsistent with the successful American economy of the 20th
century--when prudently used.""

??In fact, he said, ""it's as American as apple pie.""

??So then, how would a seizure work?

??Angelides picked up a government code book and read aloud the section that
empowers the governor ""in a state of emergency to commandeer or utilize any
private property or personnel deemed by him necessary in carrying out the
responsibilities hereby vested in him as chief executive of the state, and the
state shall pay a reasonable value thereof.""

??He explained that the governor would issue an order to give the state
temporary title to either a plant or the power it produced. The plant would 
keep
operating as usual. Once the energy crisis had passed, ownership would be
returned to the private company and there would be negotiations or court
contests to determine the ""reasonable value"" of what the state had taken. The
question of reasonable value, of course, is where the accountants come in,
attempting to prove that their prices were reasonable.

??""It might be worth seizing the contracts of one power plant,"" Angelides 
said,
""just to see how they could justify these prices. They couldn't.""

??What plants do we seize?

??Angelides made reference to the 23 California plants purchased by outside
companies, most of them Texas-based, after the state's deregulation plan was
hatched. The utilities sold these plants--constituting about a third of the
state's generating capacity--for a total of about $3.2 billion. At the time, 
it
was thought that PG&E and Edison had snookered the Texans. Hah.

??The treasurer said his staff, using figures favorable to the generators'
case, has calculated that the reasonable price of power from these plants 
ought
to be running at about $110 to $150 an hour. Instead, they are commanding 
prices
double or triple that amount. Said Angelides: ""They are making profits unseen
any time in our history, a classic example of a private market run amok.""

??OK, then, when do we saddle up?

??It is the governor's call, but in Angelides' view seizures should be made
only if current ""obscene prices"" jump even higher this summer to a level of
""horrifically obscene prices."" At present, he said, through a combination of
bonds, rate increases and aggressive conservation, the state can stagger 
through
the crisis and into a more orderly energy future.

??If wholesale prices shoot any higher, though, the plan will collapse, 
leaving
California with few options. Rates cannot be raised again without jeopardizing
the economy. The bond card has been played to the hilt. And there are limits 
to
how much demand can be curbed by conservation. What's left? Plant seizures, of
course. Action.

HEADLINE: Estate Tax Repeal to Hurt State Revenue;
Finances: Without a portion of the federal money, California stands to lose 
$356
million next year as the credit is phased out.

BYLINE: LIZ PULLIAM WESTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

BODY:

??At a time when energy woes and a slowing economy are threatening 
California's
fiscal health, Congress' repeal of federal estate taxes is expected to cost 
the
state $356 million next year and more than $1 billion annually by 2005.

??In fact, California stands to lose more money than any other state as the
repeal legislation reduces the number of people who face the estate tax and
chokes off the portion of federal revenue that used to be diverted to the
states.

??""Given the circumstances we find ourselves in right now, this certainly will
make future budgets tighter and more difficult,"" said Brad Williams, senior
economist for the California Legislative Analyst's office.

??Few state officials were willing Wednesday to publicly criticize the popular
repeal plan, despite the cost. State Controller Kathleen Connell said that
estate tax repeal was supported by most Californians, who eliminated the 
state's
own estate tax by a 64% majority in a 1982 referendum.

??""Any loss of revenue, when we're impacted doubly by the energy crisis and 
the
slowing economy, is going to be painful,"" Connell said. ""But I find it hard to
argue against eliminating the federal tax when we eliminated our own.""

??Although California repealed its own estate tax, it--like every other
state--continues to collect a portion of the federal taxes levied each year on
the estates of affluent Americans who die.

??This so-called state death tax credit has been part of federal estate tax 
law
since 1926, and essentially allows states to coordinate their own estate taxes
with that of the federal government.

??States that don't have estate or inheritance taxes of their own collect the
full amount of the credit they're allowed under federal estate tax law. Many 
of
the 12 states that have their own estate tax systems collect the difference
between the federal credit they're allowed and the amount of money they 
collect
directly from their citizens.

??California, thanks to its huge population and wealth, is by far the largest
recipient of the credit. The Golden State received $937 million in estate tax
revenue in fiscal year 1999-2000--an amount equal to 1.3% of the state general
fund, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonpartisan
research group. Nationwide, states collected more than $5.5 billion in 2000,
according to the group's figures.

??To reduce the overall cost of estate tax repeal, however, Congress decided 
to
phase out the states' ability to collect this revenue--and to do it twice as
fast as the phase-out of estate taxes overall.

??By 2005, the states will no longer receive a portion of federal estate tax
revenue, even though the federal government is scheduled to continue 
collecting
estate taxes until 2010. The changes were part of the $1.35-trillion tax cut
approved by Congress on Saturday.

??Congress' repeal plan also will decrease the number of people who are 
subject
to the tax by 40% by raising the amount of money that can be passed tax-free 
to
heirs. Next year, for example, people who die can leave up to $1 million 
without
having to pay estate taxes, up from $675,000 this year.

??Congress' changes are expected to cost California $356 million in fiscal 
year
2002-2003, said Sandy Harrison, assistant director for the state Department of
Finance. That's enough money to pay salaries and benefits for nearly 12,000
beginning teachers, said Mike Myslinski, spokesman for the California Teachers
Assn.

??The losses will mount to $1.1 billion by 2005 and $1.5 billion by the time
the federal estate tax is scheduled to be eliminated on Dec. 31, 2009.

??California is facing other strains on its budget, including more than $7
billion spent so far to purchase electricity and a $5.6-billion drop in taxes
collected from stock options and capital gains, thanks to stock market
slowdowns.

??But California isn't the only state that will suffer. Florida collected $779
million last year--4.1% of its general revenue--while New York collected $450
million, or 1.3% of its revenue, from the state death tax credit, according to
the research group's figures.

??Nevada--which like Florida has no personal income tax--may take the biggest
hit. Nevada collected $76.7 million from federal estate tax revenue, an amount
equal to 4.9% of its general fund revenue.

??""[Nevada and Florida] don't have a personal income tax, so they're more
reliant on other sources of revenue,"" such as the estate tax, said Arturo 
Perez,
senior policy specialist for the National Conference of State Legislatures.

??Unlike most other states, Nevada segregates estate tax money into a special
endowment fund to pay for education, including University of Nevada programs,
state officials said.

HEADLINE: Bush's Mistake in California

BYLINE: ?By Gray Davis; Gray Davis is the governor of California.

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO

BODY:

??I hope President Bush understands how perilous a course he is setting for
both California and the national economy with his opposition to caps on the
outrageously high wholesale price of electricity -- opposition he reiterated 
to
me when we met Tuesday.

??California is experiencing an energy shock like that perpetrated by the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in the 1970's. That episode
plunged the United States into deep recession and gave rise to a long period 
of
stagflation -- rising prices in a no-growth economy.

???The size of the energy shock to California this year is likely to be in the
range of $40 billion to $50 billion, according to Alan Blinder, the former 
vice
chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. It is enough to threaten the still 
solid
California economy with recession and to knock the nation's gross domestic
product down by at least half a percent -- enough to counter the stimulative
effects that the Bush tax cut is intended to have on the stumbling national
economy. As the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, observed in late January, ""It is
scarcely credible that you can have a major economic problem in California 
which
does not feed to the rest of the 49 states.""

??The president's energy policy sets long-term goals of self-sufficiency
through increased power generation, energy efficiency and fuel supplies. These
are many of the same solutions we in California are rapidly pursuing. But the
short-run emergency in California stems as much from energy cost as from 
energy
supply.

??Since I've been in office, we've cut approval times in half and licensed 15
major power plants. And we have put in place the nation's most comprehensive
conservation program. Still, we are being squeezed to the breaking point by
outrageous prices for the electricity we buy. This is why I called on the
president for an energy policy that includes short-term caps on the price of
wholesale power. Under the Federal Power Act of 1935, only the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission has the power to ensure a just and reasonable wholesale
electricity market in California. This is not a matter of discretion for 
federal
regulators; it is an obligation. The law requires the F.E.R.C. to ensure that
rates are just and reasonable. California itself can do nothing about the
unconscionable wholesale electricity prices that are often more than 700 
percent
higher than they were just a year ago. President Bush must direct the 
commission
to exercise its authority under the law.

??In a letter Tuesday to the president, 10 economists warned, ""F.E.R.C.'s
failure to act now will have dire consequences for the State of California and
will set back, potentially fatally, the diffusion of competitive electricity 
markets across the country.""

??It is true that California's problems stem from a fundamentally flawed 1996
state electricity deregulation law. The utilities were required to sell off 
half
of their fossil-fuel-fired power plants while they were barred from entering
into contracts for a long-term supply of cheap electricity. The result is an
unregulated sellers' market for electricity, susceptible to naked 
manipulation.

??The agency that runs California's power grid has identified $6 billion in
overcharges by the generators. Prices are greatly inflated. The same 
electricity
that cost Californians $7 billion in 1999 was $27 billion in 2000 and is
projected to cost upwards of $50 billion in 2001. Much of this is fed by
escalating wholesale natural gas prices that were 1,000 percent higher in
Southern California in December 2000 than in December 1999. The F.E.R.C. has
failed to curb these natural gas prices as well.

??The Bush administration still maintains that the energy policy it has
proposed is all that can reasonably be done and says it opposes further 
federal
intervention in the energy market, even if the problem threatens the nation's
economy. The threat is real, and the Bush administration must adopt a more
responsible energy policy, one that restrains energy price manipulation and
creates a fair and competitive energy market across the West and the whole
country.

HEADLINE: In California, Blackouts Spur A Search forHome Remedies

BYLINE: ?By LAURA M. HOLSON

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 30

BODY:

??For Evans Keller, a turkey farmer in the Central Valley of California, the
energy crisis has become a matter of life and death.

??For 17 years, he and his family have raised turkeys near Fresno, far from 
the
dot-com companies of Silicon Valley and the ""Baywatch"" beaches most outsiders
associate with the state. In his world, where daily summer temperatures soar
above 100 degrees on dusty ranches, Mr. Keller is forced to use electric fans
and fog-making machines to cool his one million turkeys -- or watch them roast
in tin-roofed sheds.

???But with energy experts forecasting more than 260 hours of blackouts this
summer and no relief in sight from regulators or politicians, Mr. Keller has
taken matters into his own hands. In April, he bought eight small generators 
at
Costco that he could hook up to tractors and use to keep the fans and misters
running when the Pacific Gas and Electric Company cuts his power.

??Since then he has regularly conducted drills on the 14 farms that supply him
with turkeys -- 4 farms he owns and 10 run by independent contractors -- and 
has
spent weeks winnowing the routine down to 40 minutes, barely enough time 
before
the birds begin to wither under the searing sun.

??""Believe me, we're not proud,"" said Mr. Keller, who said he had appealed
earlier this year, without success, to Pacific Gas and Electric for advance
warnings of blackouts. ""We'll do what we have to to protect our investment.""

??The energy crisis here has come to this: from tourist attractions in sunny
Southern California, to farmers who dominate the central region of the state, 
to
technology concerns up north, businesses are coming up with novel ways to cope
with what many fear will be an unpleasant summer.

??The concerns are understandable given the issues that many businesses face,
including lost revenue and potential layoffs, as the state's power shortages
continue. ""The uncertainty is what kills you,"" Jerry Meek, utility operations
manager at Roche Pharmaceuticals in Palo Alto, said.

??Trying to reduce that uncertainty, businesses are applying to the state's
Public Utilities Commission for exemptions from having their power turned off
this summer. (The deadline is Friday.) Last week, Gov. Gray Davis announced 
that
the state would begin a three-tiered warning system for residences and
businesses that are likely to be affected. The first warning will come two 
days
before a blackout; the second, one day in advance; and the final warning, one
hour before the lights go out.

??A more radical approach is being suggested by Mike Briggs, a Republican
assemblyman from Fresno. He is asking the state to schedule potential blackout
days as much as months in advance so business owners know when their turn is
coming. ""It is scary what this has come to,"" Mr. Briggs said. ""But this gives
people options.""

??Farmers in the Central Valley, for instance, have to order water for their
crops a day ahead. But if the power is off when the water shows up in an
irrigation canal, he said, ""they can't open the gates and the water flows 
right
past them."" One business owner told Mr. Briggs that he spent $30,000 one month
to lease two generators that were never used. ""He said it would have been nice
to know ahead of time so he could rent the generators for a day,"" the
assemblyman said.

??Of course critics worry that burglars will know when the lights go out, too.
""Yes, there is the downside of more potential burglaries,"" Mr. Briggs said. 
""But
maybe people are willing to make that trade-off.""

??Even those business owners who say they are currently protected from power
failures are making preparations -- just in case. The Legoland California 
amusement park in Carlsbad, near San Diego, has an arrangement with its 
utility,
the San Diego Gas and Electric Company, to keep the lights on, said a
spokeswoman, Courtney Simmons. Still, she added, the park is prepared in the
event of a loss.

??The contingency plan consists of keeping open the 3 rides, of the 20 total,
that are not powered by electricity, she said. Barbecues would be rolled out 
to
cook food, and the park's boulevards would be flooded with performers, 
including
singers, dancers, jugglers and musicians who will entertain until the power
comes back on. ""We are prepared for outages no matter what the cause this
summer,"" she said.

??Many tourist attractions, including Disneyland in Anaheim, are already
prepared because they upgraded their systems in 1999, fearing a Year 2000
disaster that would threaten the power grid. ""A lot of these things were 
already
tested and documented,"" said Ray Gomez, director of communications at 
Disneyland
Resorts. ""We are skilled at emergency evacuations. Energy is only one part of
that.""

??As part of its plan, Disneyland shored up its emergency operations center,
holding employee drills to turn on emergency power. This summer, Disneyland 
will
have employee volunteers who roam the park day and night, turning out lights 
and
replacing incandescent bulbs with more energy-efficient ones. The park also
works with the city of Anaheim, which supplies the park with power, to 
conserve
5 to 10 percent, minimizing the risk of blackouts at all.

??Oddly enough, Disneyland is reviving its Main Street Electrical Parade, a
29-year-old light show that had most recently been an attraction in Florida.
Leslie Goodman, a senior vice president for strategic communications for Walt
Disney Parks and Resorts, said the park had made sure that the parade did not
use energy when Californians need it most. The lights in the parade are 
powered
by battery, and are recharged during off-peak hours. But, she added, despite
what was a difficult decision and a potential public relations nightmare, ""the
show goes on.""

??While most businesses make an effort to conserve (if for no other reason 
than
to save money as rates soar), some communities are giving corporations added
incentives. The city of Palo Alto, for example, has agreed not to cut off 
power
to Roche Pharmaceuticals as long as the company reduces energy consumption by 
15
percent within 30 minutes of an announced Stage 3 alert, the state's most
critical. Only once has Roche lost power, said Mr. Meek, the company's utility
operations manager. And that, he added, was because of a mistake.

??Roche has a plan to ensure that a blackout does not happen. Once Mr. Meek
gets an alert on his pager from a city representative (who can see how much is
being saved because the company has a real-time meter for the 15-building
campus), voice mail and e-mail messages are sent to more than 1,000 employees
asking them to turn off nonessential lights. The air-conditioning is changed 
to
raise the temperature in most areas to 78 degrees from a normal 72 degrees.
Lighting in all offices is reduced, and some employees move from their dark
cubicles to the window-walled cafeteria to work, he said.

??""The question is, do you treasure light or do you want your computer shut
down?"" Mr. Meek asked. If these measures do not reduce overall demand by 15
percent, Roche will switch on backup generators to power the laboratories. 
Why?
If laboratory tools are not properly shut off before a loss of power, it takes
days to recalibrate them, costing thousands of dollars and wasted time, Mr. 
Meek
said. ""My focus with the uncertainty is to do what we can to get around it,"" 
he
said.

??One way that California businesses are seeking certainty is by appealing to
the state's Public Utilities Commission for relief. One commissioner, Carl 
Wood,
said in a recent interview that about half the customers who got electricity 
from the state's three largest utilities were exempt from blackouts because
their services were considered essential, like fire stations or hospitals, or
because they shared power with an essential source. No more than 60 percent of
the state's customers can be exempted from blackouts.

??Recently, an exemption was granted for the Bay Area Rapid Transit District,
which runs 95 miles of commuter train service in the San Francisco 
metropolitan
area, Mr. Wood said. Pacific Bell Park, home of the San Francisco Giants, has
asked for one, too; that request is being reviewed.

??""It can be extremely disruptive and expensive if there are lots of blackouts
this summer,"" he said. ""This is a big economic issue.""

??Just imagine, he said, musing about how the summer could end: ""Disneyland
without rides?""

HEADLINE: San Jose mayor reverses position, endorses Calpine power plant 
project

BYLINE: By Mike Zapler

BODY:

??SAN JOSE, Calif. _ After a year of staunch opposition to a major power plant
in South San Jose, Mayor Ron Gonzales reversed course Wednesday and endorsed 
the
project, removing the largest remaining barrier to construction and angering
residents of a nearby neighborhood he had pledged to protect.

??Speaking before news cameras and reporters in his City Hall office Wednesday
afternoon, Gonzales said he had negotiated an agreement with Calpine that 
eased
his concerns about the Metcalf Energy Center project. The deal, he said,
contains provisions to help shield the Santa Teresa neighborhood from air
pollution, gives local businesses the chance to negotiate below-market
electricity rates and provides a sure energy source for local residents.

??""We need power in San Jose and we believe this power plant is needed in San
Jose,"" Gonzales said. ""We've worked hard to make this plant better for the
neighborhoods and better for the city.""

??But the city entered talks with Calpine about five weeks ago in a vastly
weakened position, and its chief negotiator, mayoral budget director Joe 
Guerra,
was unable to extract most of the concessions the city and neighborhood had
sought. Santa Teresa leader Elizabeth Cord called the neighborhood protection
provisions ""totally not substantive,"" and another opponent said a lawsuit is
likely if the plant is ultimately approved.

??""The mayor's deal does nothing to reduce the impact on this neighborhood,""
Santa Teresa activist Issa Ajlouny said. ""It's the same project as it was two
years ago except San Jose residents will be paying millions of dollars more.""

??Cisco Systems, which is planning a 20,000-worker campus adjacent to the
proposed plant and has strenuously opposed it, appears to be softening its
opposition. Kent Jenkins Jr., a spokesman for the company, said Wednesday that
Cisco would still prefer not to have the plant, but that officials were 
pleased,
at first glance, with the health and safety concessions Gonzales had 
negotiated.
Asked whether Cisco might file a lawsuit, Jenkins said, ""we're not ruling
anything in or out and by that, I don't want to imply we are considering
anything.""

??He added that the agreement will have no bearing on the company's plans to
build the campus. ""All along we were committed to pursuing Coyote Valley and
that remains unchanged,"" he said.

??With experts predicting a summer of rolling blackouts, and with the
California Energy Commission expected soon to override the city council's
November rejection of the plant, Gonzales was under enormous pressure to 
strike
a deal. Polls taken by Calpine had shown overwhelming public support for the
plant, another ominous sign for the mayor who is up for re-election next year.

??While the city probably could not have blocked approval of the plant once it
got state approval, the mayor indicated as late as April 18 that the city 
might
fight it in court. But that possibility vanished with Wednesday's 
announcement,
leaving a possible neighborhood-backed lawsuit as the only potential threat.

??""This power plant is coming to San Jose. That's clear from the support it 
has
gathered in Sacramento,"" Gonzales conceded, referring to Gov. Gray Davis' 
endorsement in April. So rather than continue to fight an uphill battle,
Gonzales decided it was best to negotiate what he could.

??At the press conference, Gonzales touted provisions in the deal that will
provide two additional air monitoring stations to ensure the plant complies 
with
local air quality standards. The agreement also provides a three-month window,
prior to the plant's opening, for San Jose businesses to negotiate long-term
power contracts with the Metcalf plant at a ""below market"" rate, said Calpine 
chief executive officer Peter Cartwright.

??But the city clearly got less than it wanted, which was at least partly the
price of Gonzales' longtime resistance to the 600-megawatt plant:

??_One key negotiating point was how much Calpine would pay to extend a
recycled-water pipeline seven miles to the plant site. The city started by
asking the company to pay at least $25 million of the roughly $50 million 
price
tag. But, in a provision Gonzales touted as a victory, Calpine will pay 20
percent of the cost, or $10 million, and the city will pick up the remaining 
$40
million. Calpine said the company is simply paying its fair share.

??_In an effort to protect neighborhoods from pollution, the city wanted
Metcalf to operate full time, since emissions are highest when a power plant
first fires up. The city tried to arrange a long-term contract with the state 
to
buy power from Metcalf to keep it running constantly, but officials balked at
such a commitment.

??Calpine said it intends to keep the plant running constantly as long as
demand _ in the form of annual contracts with the state _ justifies it. If
demand is lacking, the company will lower the number of potential times the
generator will start up by 25 percent, from 624 per year to 468 annually. That
restriction would last five years, by which time the energy crisis in 
California
is expected to be long over.

??_In the fall, Calpine offered $10 million in electricity discounts to help
win the city's backing for Metcalf. Wednesday's agreement includes a $6.5
million benefits package, including $5 million for parks and open space
acquisition in Santa Teresa; $1 million for energy conservation programs and
assistance to low-income people to help pay their energy bills; and $500,000 
to
help provide health insurance to San Jose children.

??_Calpine has agreed to install new technologies that reduce or eliminate the
use of ammonia, which would be extremely hazardous if accidentally released, 
as
soon as those systems are deemed ""economically feasible"" and approved by state
regulators. But because there is no standard in the agreement, the burden 
would
fall on the city to prove that a new technology was feasible. If the two sides
disagreed, the decision would fall to a third-party arbitrator.

??There is also a significant question of whether ammonia-free technology,
known as SCONOx, already is viable _ a position taken by the U.S. 
Environmental
Protection Agency.

??Calpine's Cartwright, who appeared at the press conference with Gonzales,
said Wednesday that the company is committed to switching as soon as possible
from liquid ammonia to less hazardous solid ammonia.

??The city council is scheduled to take up the agreement at its Tuesday
meeting. Although Gonzales persuaded the council to vote with him against the
controversial project last fall, most members are expected to go along with 
the
mayor's switch.

??The project would then go through the city planning process again this fall.
Calpine hopes to begin construction this year and to have the plant up and
running by summer 2003.

HEADLINE: Plan would have biggest customers pay Edison's debt

SOURCE: Sacramento Bureau Chief

BYLINE: Greg Lucas

DATELINE: Sacramento

BODY:
Legislative leaders are drafting a new rescue plan for Southern California
Edison that would put the utility back on its feet financially at the expense 
of
its biggest customers.

???The plan would leave manufacturers, refineries and other big industrial
customers with the burden of paying nearly all the utility's $3.5 billion back
debt through a dedicated charge. Residential and small commercial users would 
be
on the hook for only a fraction of the back debt.

???Big users say it is unfair to saddle them with all of Edison's debt, but
supporters of the plan say it's these users that wanted deregulation and 
should
shoulder the costs it created.

???""We're trying to put something together in a way that solves all these
problems, and if people are to be pigheaded about it, we won't solve any
problems,"" said Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek (Santa Cruz County).

???Although the plan is an alternative to Gov. Gray Davis' proposed deal to 
put
Edison back on its feet financially, it could be used as a model to help 
restore
Pacific Gas and Electric Co. to solvency.

???Democrats say the plan contains some elements desired by Republicans, but
GOP lawmakers object to saddling large business users with Edison's debt.

???The plan is based on the way gas customers are divided into ""core"" and
""noncore"" users.

???SEPARATING 'CORE' USERS

???Under this proposal, electrical users would be divided the same way. Core
users would be customers who use 500 kilowatts or less a month. Noncore would 
be
those using more than 500 kilowatts.

???Out of Edison's 4.2 million customers, only 3,600 would be noncore
customers. But those 3,600 customers use about 26 percent of Edison's demand 
for
energy.

???Core customers would get their power from generators owned by Edison,
long-term contracts and alternative energy producers, such as wind farms and
solar panels, on contract with the utility.

???That would mean those customers would no longer be subject to the whims of
the spot market, which has far higher prices than other sources of 
electricity.

???Large users, the noncore customers, would be given the right to negotiate 
to
buy their power directly from generators or build on-site power plants to make
themselves energy self-sufficient.

???The plan would be phased in through January 2003 to give large energy
customers time to prepare for buying power on the open market.

???During that period, residential, small business and large industrial users
would all share in paying off Edison's debt. But in 2003, that burden would
shift exclusively to the big users.

???Republican lawmakers and those same large users have been clamoring to be
given what is called ""direct access"" to generators so they can negotiate 
cheaper
rates.

???Enron is also backing the idea of cutting loose the largest electricity
users because that would create a built-in market for the energy the company
sells.

???Large users who want to remain on the grid could do so.

???EDISON 'ENCOURAGED'

???Sources said Edison officials met with lawmakers over the weekend to iron
out details of the plan.

???A spokesman for Edison said he was ""encouraged"" by the talks.

???""I haven't seen a finished product or a plan,"" said Bob Foster, a senior
vice president with Edison. ""They're approaching this in a spirit of goodwill
and trying to find a solution.""

???Big businesses complain that the plan does not work because right now, 
there
is nowhere they can buy cheap electricity.

???""We're very concerned that separating the core from the noncore means we
will experience extreme rate hikes over the next two years,"" said D.J. Smith, 
a
lobbyist for the California Large Energy Consumers Association.

???""When you add blackouts, the multiple interruptions of production and
another potentially huge rate hike, the result would be catastrophic to the
economy,"" Smith said.

???Added Dorothy Rothrock, a lobbyist for the California Manufacturers and
Technology Association: ""What's the rationale for the noncore to be paying the
entire Edison undercollection? It sounds to me like just pure politics. They
don't want voters to pay because they vote.""

???CONSUMER ADVOCATE SMELLS A RAT

???Harvey Rosenfield, head of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights,
said he thought the plan would eventually turn into a bailout as business
interests muscle lawmakers into pushing some portion of Edison's debt onto
residential and smaller commercial customers.

???""I think it's a trick. We've seen this same tactic used at the Public
Utilities Commission, where what were supposed to be rate increases for big
business end up costing more for residential and small businesses,"" Rosenfield
said.

???The new plan also does not include the outright purchase of Edison's part 
of
the transmission system that loops electricity around the state.

???Davis backs buying the lines for $2.7 billion. Democrats have insisted that
for the state's financial help, taxpayers receive something of value.

???Republicans have insisted that they will back no proposal that includes
state purchase of transmission lines.

???In the new proposal, the state would have a five-year option to buy the
transmission lines for $1.2 billion -- the book value of the asset.

???In addition, the utility would make $1.5 billion available to the state to
either purchase other assets -- such as Edison's hydroelectric facilities, for
example -- or use it in partnership to build new power plants.E-mail Greg

HEADLINE: Regulators want state trade-off for caps;

Davis asked to give up control of power lines

SOURCE: Chronicle Staff Writer

BYLINE: Bernadette Tansey

BODY:
California's testy relationship with federal energy regulators could turn 
into a
showdown tomorrow, when state power officials must decide whether to surrender
some control over the state's electricity market or risk losing limited price
curbs that kicked in this week.

???In agreeing last month to set flexible caps to restrict price gouging 
during
electricity shortages, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said the state
and its utilities must agree to let an independent organization manage
California's power transmission lines.

???Under that setup, California would be one of a group of Western states
sharing a linked transmission grid whose rates and access rules would be set 
by
independent managers.

???It is part of the commission's drive to create regional electricity markets
throughout the country and make it easier to trade power across state lines. 
The
regional grids would be a prelude to the nationwide free market in electricity
advocated by the Bush administration and power marketers like Enron. ?

???But California Assembly Democrats who have challenged the federal demand 
say
the requirement could interfere with some of the state's homegrown solutions 
to
its energy crisis, such as Gov. Gray Davis' proposal that the state buy and 
run
transmission lines owned by Southern California Edison Co.

???""A lot of folks were wondering how those two things would interact and are
they mutually exclusive,"" said Paul Hefner, an aide to Assembly Speaker Robert
Hertzberg, D-Sherman Oaks.

???Other officials say the federal requirement is premature because no 
regional
organization yet exists that California can join.

???Mike Florio, a board member of the California Independent System Operator,
which manages the state's power grid, said California is already part of
regional efforts to clear transmission bottlenecks and share surplus power. 
But
Florio said no Western state will rush into a regional arrangement and 
surrender
part of its authority without ensuring a good deal for its own consumers.

???""We certainly don't want to be forced into an entity where generators or
power marketers get to dictate the terms,"" Florio said. ""This has got to be a
long courtship rather than a shotgun wedding.""

???When federal regulators initiated the move toward regional transmission
grids during the Clinton administration in 1999, participation was voluntary,
said Gary Cohen, general counsel to the state Public Utilities Commission.

???But in its April 26 order, the federal energy commission made its offer of
limited price relief contingent on a filing by June 1 from the Independent
System Operator committing the state to a regional management plan.

???The PUC and the Assembly are challenging that requirement. If anything,
Cohen said, the state needs to increase control over its energy system while 
it
recovers from its disastrous debut into deregulation, rather than submit to a
regional authority that would be overseen by the federal government.

???""This doesn't seem to be the time to be doing more experimenting,"" Cohen
said. ""We certainly have not been able to rely on FERC to look out for the
interests of Californians.""

???WAITING FOR STATE'S RESPONSE

???Curt Hebert, chairman of the federal commission, declined to say yesterday
whether the government would immediately yank the soft price caps that went 
into
effect this week if it found the ISO response unsatisfactory.

???""He said he didn't want to prejudge the case,"" said commission spokeswoman
Tamara Young-Allen. ""He will wait to see what California files.""

???PUC Commissioner Jeff Brown said he would be willing to give up some state
control of the grid in exchange for meaningful price controls. But, he said, 
the
federal measures granted fell far short of what California needed.

???""Hell, those caps are pretty toothless as they are,"" Brown said.

???The price controls are in effect only during power shortages. The cap is 
the
price offered by the least-efficient generating plant. And generators can
challenge any federal ruling that they have exceeded the caps, by claiming 
high
costs.

???The controls were in place for the first time yesterday, when the state
declared a Stage 2 power emergency, meaning reserves fell below 5 percent of
available capacity.

???Florio said state power managers' answer to the federal government will
probably be that they are already doing within California much of what a
regional transmission organization would do.

???ISO COULD PLAY A ROLE

???The ISO manages the grid to ensure that power gets to where it is needed in
the state, the organization told federal regulators in January. The agency 
could
represent California when a Western regional organization develops, it said.

???The governor declined to say yesterday what stand he would take on federal
regulators' demand.

???""I'm of a mind to do something, but I still have to talk to my lawyers,""
Davis said.

???Assembly Democrats say regulators in Washington have no right to withhold
actions to correct California's dysfunctional power market.

???""They're required to . . . ensure that just and reasonable rates prevail in
the market,"" Hefner said. ""Why should we have to dicker to get them to do the
job Congress created them to do?""E-mail Bernadette Tansey at

HEADLINE: Municipal utilities warned;

Governor says he'll seize excess electricity if prices don't come down

SOURCE: Chronicle Staff Writer

BYLINE: David Lazarus

DATELINE: Sacramento

BODY:
Gov. Gray Davis threatened last night to seize excess power generated by
California's municipal utility districts, which he said have charged even 
higher
electricity prices than out-of-state generators.

???Davis said in an interview with The Chronicle that some municipal utility
districts have charged the state as much as 10 percent more than the average
wholesale cost demanded by private power companies.

???The governor's tough talk came as California suffered through a Stage 2
power alert and faced the prospect of a long, hot summer of rolling blackouts
and skyrocketing electricity prices. So far this year, the state has paid more
than $8.2 billion to buy power for its cash-strapped utilities.

???In a variation on his threat to seize power plants from out-of-state
generators if they continue gouging California ratepayers, the governor said 
he
would use his executive powers to claim excess juice from the locally owned
utilities if they do not lower their prices.

???He said he is ready to go to court if they offer resistance.

???""We're going to get that power one way or another,"" Davis said.

???Municipal utilities are city-owned power companies. In Northern California,
there are municipal utilities in Alameda, Palo Alto, Redding, Sacramento and
Santa Clara. Los Angeles has the largest municipal utility in the state.

???30 DAYS TILL CONTRACT DETAILS

???For the first time, the governor also gave a time frame for releasing
details of more than 40 long-term electricity contracts California is signing
with generators since the financial meltdown of the state's two biggest
utilities.

???He said that after about six more contracts get nailed down, he expects 
full
details to be made available within 30 days.

???Although the contracts involve nearly $40 billion in public funds, Davis 
and
other state officials have adamantly refused to divulge their contents,
insisting that secrecy is needed to remain competitive during negotiations.

???The Chronicle and other media outlets have filed suit for access to the
contracts, arguing that the public has a right to know how its money is being
spent.

???RUDE AWAKENING

???While going toe-to-toe with the out-of-state generators, the last thing
Davis needed was for municipal utilities -- the home team, as it were -- to
emulate the Texas big boys and dig deep into California's pockets.

???Yet the governor's negotiators have been struggling for weeks to convince
municipals that they are obliged to provide power at cost -- which Davis
insisted they are required to do by law.

???He met last week with the heads of a dozen municipal utilities and told 
them
explicitly that he would not tolerate gouging from within the state as
California faces a summer of potential blackouts.

???The governor said after the meeting that the municipals had agreed ""to make
most of their excess power available this summer . . . at prices significantly
lower than those being charged on the spot market.""

???Apparently, however, little progress has been made since that declaration.

???Davis told The Chronicle last night that he is still ""trying very hard to
promote this notion that we're all in this together.""

???While unwilling to specify which municipal utilities have been most
aggressive in their pricing, and refusing to place a dollar amount on how much
the utilities charged, Davis said he is prepared to seize up to 800 megawatts 
of
output if the they do not change their ways.

???Eight hundred megawatts is enough power to light about 800,000 homes.

???Representatives of the various municipal utilities could not be reached for
comment, nor could a spokesperson for the California Municipal Utilities
Association in Sacramento.

???""I told them that they will either (reduce their prices) voluntarily or
involuntarily,"" the governor said.

???UNCERTAIN FUTURE

???It remains to be seen, however, whether the municipal utilities will play
ball. To date, they have shown a firm inclination to go their own way.

???In March, Lodi's municipal utility district and a Northern California 
municipal utility cooperative that includes Palo Alto, Santa Clara and Alameda
told Pacific Gas and Electric Co. that they will not participate in rolling
blackouts during power shortages.

???""I won't arbitrarily screw my customers . . . so 5,000 PG&E customers can
turn on their lights somewhere else,"" said Alan Vallow, director of the 
utility
serving Lodi's 58,000 residents.E-mail David Lazarus at

State awaiting bold act by Davis;

Rhetoric buys time but summer's near

SOURCE: Chronicle Sacramento Bureau

BYLINE: Lynda Gledhill

DATELINE: Sacramento

BODY:
Gov. Gray Davis may have scored a victory by publicly clashing with President
Bush this week on energy policy, but the governor's tough rhetoric also raises
expectations for bold action as a summer of rolling blackouts bears down on
California.

???With little hope that federal regulators will adopt broad price controls on
wholesale electricity prices, Davis will have to chart his own course to take
Californians through the summer without loss of life or bankrupting the state.

???""If the federal government continues their current policies, and if we have
a very bad summer in terms of blackouts and heat waves, then the governor will
be forced to take other steps,"" said Tim Hodson, director of the Center for
California Studies at California State University at Sacramento.

???So far, Davis -- known for his cautious and micromanaging style -- has been
reluctant to make sweeping use of his emergency powers and has won few major
victories in California's energy crisis. The state's largest utility has filed
for bankruptcy, and the state has spent more than $8 billion to buy 
electricity
on behalf of the utilities.

???Davis said yesterday that he will ""fight like hell"" to get California some
relief from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. He said he would move
forward with a lawsuit against the federal agency if it does not impose price
caps.

???But although beating the drum of federal intervention may have given Davis 
a
temporary boost this week, sustaining that level of rhetoric won't be 
effective
over the long term, said Bob Waste, a professor at California State 
University,
Sacramento.

???""He's made it harder for the president to do not very much,"" he said. ""But 
I
think the governor has to look at playing the bases and using eminent domain.""

???As recently as this week, Davis raised the possibility of seizing power
plants.

???""Once the president said it was time to stop playing politics, Davis had to
ratchet back the rhetoric,"" agreed political analyst Sherry Bebitch Jeffe. ""He
was precluded from using the federal government as the villain.""

???The Bush visit gave Davis, mentioned as a possible challenger to Bush in
2004, a national spotlight on a scale he had not had before. He did interviews
with all the networks and even won five minutes at the top of CNN's ""Larry 
King
Live,"" a spot long coveted by the administration.

???The 35-minute, tightly choreographed meeting between Davis and Bush yielded
little progress, but it was a good political show, Hodson said.

???But Davis may now have to seriously consider the choices he so far has been
reluctant to take: seizing power plants, slapping a windfall profits tax on
out-of-state generators or scheduling blackouts. Last night, he raised another
possibility: seizing excess power generated by municipal utilities that the
governor says have gouged the state.

???Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco, said it's time for
Davis to take some dramatic action.

???""Clearly, the only people who are going to help us is ourselves,"" he said.

???State Treasurer Phil Angelides now advocates commandeering plants if
generators continue to raise the price of electricity sold on the spot market.

???Davis' plan to rescue Southern California Edison from following Pacific Gas
& Electric Co. into bankruptcy has stalled in the Legislature. Many lawmakers
wonder what would be so terrible about letting the courts handle such an
extremely delicate issue.

???And lawmakers continue to mull the prospect of scheduling blackouts in an
effort to gain some control over how much money the state is spending on
electricity. At a rate of $55 million a day, the state has spent $8.2 billion 
to
buy power since Jan. 17.

???""I've got to say I'm getting there,"" Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg said
about scheduling rolling blackouts. ""At some point, we may just have to be 
like
Nancy Reagan and 'Just say no.' ""

???But Davis has wavered on the plan, at first saying his preference was to
keep the lights on no matter what the cost, then saying it was an idea he 
would
consider.

HEADLINE: FERC is shirking its responsibilities

BYLINE: John A. Russo, John Burton, Robert M. Hertzberg

BODY:
FRONTIER TOWNS without a sheriff were not fit for families. Professional
baseball games would be meaningless without umpires to call plays fairly. And 
a
regional electricity market descends into naked greed if its federally 
mandated
referee walks off the job.

???Last week, the city of Oakland and the state Legislature filed a landmark
lawsuit against the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to compel FERC to do
its job.

???Our case is critical to California, and its outcome may well affect
consumers and businesses across America.

???In 1999, more than two years after deregulation, one megawatt hour of
electricity in California cost an average of $30.

???Today, the spot market price has spiked to more than $1,900 -- 63 times the
post-deregulation cost. This cost explosion was not caused by California's 
admittedly troubled attempt at deregulation, but deregulation clearly invited
electricity providers to exploit a chaotic marketplace.

???Ethics aside, electricity generators have done what commodity producers 
have
always done: Charge as much as the market will bear.

???Understanding this essential truth about commodity markets and recognizing
the critical role energy plays in our economy and our lives, Congress created
FERC. Unfortunately for Californians, FERC stubbornly refuses to fulfill its
statutory obligation to ensure ""just and reasonable"" energy rates.

???As a result, Californians are suffering immediate, irreparable harm and
jeopardy to our health and safety.

???In light of FERC's utter abdication of its mandate to protect the public
interest, the state Legislature, on behalf of all Californians, and the city 
of
Oakland, on behalf of its residents, were forced to petition for relief in 
U.S.
District Court. This lawsuit is not about politics; it is not about energy
deregulation in California.

???The objective of this lawsuit is simple: FERC should do the job that
Congress created it to do. FERC should, when appropriate, limit the prices
charged by out-of-state generators and establish a refund program for the 
return
of any windfall profits they obtained.

???Ironically, FERC's own mission statement reads like a wish list for
California consumers: ""The commission chooses regulatory approaches that 
foster
competitive markets whenever possible, assures access to reliable service at a
reasonable price, and gives full and fair consideration to environmental and
community impacts in assessing the public interest of energy projects.""

???California and Oakland have a message for FERC:

???-- Fostering ""competitive markets"" does not mean that power generators
should be allowed to compete to see who can extort the highest price.

???-- ""Reliable service"" should not mean reliable rolling blackouts.

???-- Exorbitant price increases cannot be considered ""reasonable.""

???Had ""full and fair consideration"" been given, the city of Oakland and the
state of California would not be compelled to go to court.

???Much has already been written about the potential impact to the faltering
American economy from California's electricity crisis. There is also a broader
danger presented by FERC abdication. An appointed bureaucracy should not be
permitted to ignore the clear will of our democratically elected Congress. Our
fellow Americans should not be distracted by all the finger-pointing 
surrounding
California's deregulation fiasco.

???Mark this well: If FERC can get away with refusing to do its job here in 
the
West, it can look away with similar impunity from price-gouging anywhere else 
in
the United States.

???California can tell the rest of the nation from bitter experience (and with
due respect to poet John Donne) ""Ask not for whom the price spikes. It spikes
for thee.""John A. Russo is Oakland city attorney. John Burton is president pro
tem of the state Senate. Robert M. Hertzberg is Assembly speaker.

HEADLINE: Price Caps Have Questionable Record; Even if California Gets 
Controls
on Electric Costs, They May Not Help

BYLINE: Martha McNeil Hamilton and Greg Schneider, Washington Post Staff 
Writers

BODY:




???As California Gov. Gray Davis and President Bush clash over energy policy,
their major dispute has revolved around price caps.

???Davis has argued that the best and quickest solution to California's energy
crisis would be for the federal government to rein in wholesale electricity 
costs through price caps.

???Bush has responded that caps will do nothing to lessen demand or increase
the supply of electricity. 

???This is not the first time that the government has been pressured to put a
lid on prices in the face of economic problems and public outcry. Past efforts
have had mixed results and illustrate how difficult price caps can be to
administer properly.

???President Richard Nixon, with a reelection campaign in the offing in 1971,
imposed wage and price controls to help keep inflation at bay. While hailed as
politically expedient, the system got low marks from many economists. Federal
price controls on oil resulting from the 1973 Arab embargo and controls on
natural gas were also eventually deemed ineffective and scrapped.

???Economists say that price caps make the most sense when markets are not
working properly -- when a shortage of sellers, for instance, means there is 
no
real competition. Indeed, in a market dominated by a limited number of 
sellers,
governments often have acted to regulate prices. That's how it worked in the 
old
world of regulated utilities. The utilities had to convince regulators that
price hikes were justified.

???Davis says California is struggling with a similar situation of too few
sellers, and caps are needed as an emergency measure until new power plants 
are
completed. Ten economists, including Alfred Kahn, the father of airline
deregulation, have backed California in a letter to Bush and Republican
congressional leaders.

???""Creating a well-functioning electricity market in California as soon as
possible is the best way to ensure that competition in wholesale electricity 
will spread through the U.S. and provide the greatest possible benefits to
consumers,"" the letter reads.

???The economists argued for temporary price caps and said that if the caps
were set high enough, they would not discourage competition. They warned that
the crisis in California, unless abated, could set back the cause of
deregulation. 

???Joseph Fichera, the chief executive of Saber Partners, a New York-based
consulting firm that has been advising Davis on the energy situation, argues
that Bush has misunderstood California's predicament.

???""He's talking supply and we're talking economic impact, and there's a
disconnect,"" Fichera said.

???Fichera agrees that price caps have historically tended to limit the supply
of a product, but new power plants are currently under construction. The price
caps are needed to keep the state from having to borrow billions of dollars to
pay for energy until those plants come on line.

???""Right now we're in a shortage, and just like in war or any time there's a
shortage, you have to manage that through select government intervention,""
Fichera said.

???With no help forthcoming from the president, Davis is pursuing a lawsuit
designed to force federal regulators to impose limits on wholesale prices.
Earlier this week the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission took a small step 
in
that direction, telling some wholesalers to hold down prices during shortages
severe enough to be declared state emergencies. But most out-of-state 
suppliers
and municipal systems, including the one in Los Angeles, aren't covered by the
directive.

???In California, when deregulation came, retail prices -- what residential 
and
small-business consumers play for electricity -- were reduced, and frozen for
several years.

???From mid-1998 until the middle of last December, California's Independent
System Operator -- the power-grid manager the state set up to oversee the flow
of electricity on the state's deregulated market -- imposed a price cap on
wholesale electricity. 

???The rates varied at first but eventually settled at $ 250 per megawatt. The
Independent Systems Operator then asked FERC to remove the caps in an effort 
to
encourage more supply to flow to California. 

???""In a span of three days, prices went from $ 250 a megawatt to $ 1,500,""
said Steve Maviglio, a Davis spokesman. ""It put the foot to the gas pedal in
terms of accelerating bankruptcy and putting the state in a crisis situation.""

???When wholesale prices soared, utilities ran out of money.

???Some proponents of price caps argue that FERC is obligated under the law to
step in.

???""There's a law on the books now, the Federal Power Act, which requires the
FERC to maintain just and resonable wholesale prices,"" said Linda Stuntz of
Stuntz, Davis & Staffier, a law firm whose clients include Southern 
California 
Edison.

???As long as FERC is reviewing this issue, the courts are unlikely to
intervene to help Davis, according to Stuntz and others.

???Some major consumers of electricity argue that even if FERC does act, it
would not solve their energy problems in California. 

???John Anderson of the Electricity Consumers Resource Council, which
represents major power consumers including California-based Intel Corp. and
Chevron Corp., said a price cap wouldn't cover municipal power companies or
cooperatives, or such major out-of-state suppliers as Canadian power sellers.

???""Governor Davis speaks as if FERC could wave a wand and cap all prices,""
said Anderson. California should take other steps, including raising 
residential
and small-business rates, to encourage more conservation, he said.

???Lynn Church, head of the Electric Power Supply Association, which 
represents
independent power producers and marketers -- the companies Davis largely 
blames
for the crisis -- also opposes caps.

???""By putting an artificial cap on the process, you discourage new 
development
by not sending the proper message that there is a shortage and that people 
need
to build and get into the market,"" she said. ""Secondly, it dampens the price
signal to consumers"" to use less power.

HEADLINE: Price caps don't generate energy

BODY:

??President Bush and Gov. Gray Davis face the same political firestorm in
California: Pummeled with blackouts and skyrocketing electric costs,
Californians are in a rage and demand government action.

??Davis, a Democrat with presidential aspirations, is furiously lobbying the
federal government for a quick-acting analgesic--price caps.

??But on Tuesday, during his first visit as president to California, 
Bush--much
to his credit--did not take Davis' bait. The state's energy fiasco is real and
so are the high prices, the president acknowledged, but price caps do little 
to
solve the problem. California must dampen demand and boost supplies. Price 
caps
will do neither.

??That prescription won't win Bush any political points in California--a state
he lost in November by a thumping 12 percent margin--but it's the right one.
Blunders by state government created much of the California energy crisis to
begin with, and the solution now lies in less government intervention, not 
more.

??California's problems began in 1996, with a botched attempt to deregulate 
the
electricity market that was supposed to lead to cheaper rates for consumers.
Instead it has shifted billions of dollars to energy companies and 
electricity 
brokers, many of them out of state.

??Other major miscalculations by state government preceded the deregulation 
fiasco, such as the decision by regulators in the late 1970s to force 
utilities
to buy electricity generated by alternative means, such as solar and wind
energy, often at higher prices. Southern California Edison estimates that 
since
1985 it has paid $25 billion more to buy such power than it would have cost to
generate it by traditional means.

??Meanwhile, there has been no construction of new power plants for the past
decade even though California's burgeoning electronics industry is an
electricity hog and demand has risen sharply along with the state's economic
recovery during the past five years.

??California also imports approximately 20 percent of its electricity and has
to compete with fast-growing Phoenix and Las Vegas for any regional surpluses 
of
electricity.

??There is evidence that speculation by some energy providers has worsened
California's woes. At least six investigations by state and federal agencies 
are
looking into charges of collusion or price-fixing by out-of-state energy
suppliers. This is as it should be.

??The federal government, at the behest of Bush, also has made available
subsidies to help low-income residents cope with higher bills, and is speeding
up the licensing process to build new generating plants.

??These measures will not solve California's energy crisis immediately--or 
help
Davis' or Bush's political futures.

??But rather than seek political retribution, Californians ought to pressure
politicians for real, long-term solutions, not quickie fixes. In a market
economy, that means easing demand and boosting supplies through conservation
measures and new generating capacity.

??Not fast or sexy solutions, but ones that work.

"Richard --

I was wondering if Enron had any formal policies on the release of 
information?  This is promoted by a call we had from Rep. Waxman's office.  
The Rep would like a copy of the 4 page handout that Lay gave to key 
California Republican leaders in a ""private"" meeting in Beverly Hills 
reported in the LA Times recently.

I think that we are going to give this information to Rep. Waxman's office, 
but we probably want a formal policy (ie, written) that would allow our 
legislative professionals in DC and elsewhere to say that some info is public 
and can be provided and other info will not be released.

Appreciate your help.

Jim

"Enron's preferred provider contract for administrative and office temporary 
labor with Pro Staff expires at the end of the year.  

We are currently reviewing Enron's options in the area of sourcing 
administrative and office temporary labor to provide the best service to 
Enron's user community and capture the greatest value for Enron.  As part of 
the process, a Request for Proposal (RFP) will be provided to selected 
vendors in September with a target date for selection in early November.  

The potential outcomes of the RFP process may range from selection of a 
preferred provider through use of an integrator to provide centralized 
reporting, centralized billing, and overall reduced internal administrative 
burden and costs.

Team members representing a cross section of the users of this service will 
provide requirements, evaluate vendor responses and communicate with their 
functional and Business Unit constitituents throughout this process. 

We request your feedback on specific needs or vendors you think should be

Subject: Summer internship


Dr. Kaminski,

Sorry for the late response,
it took me some time to coordinate things.
Finally, it's almost dont :-)
It turned out that from June to August
will be best for me for work at ENRON
(Say June.4 to August.4)

But I still need to know several things from your side.
Could you answer following questions?

First:
Is my suggested working period is OK with you?
If so, let me know what to do for settlement
during the period.

Second:
I got a list of work, I might be able to do for
DealBench team from Ross and Suresh.
I'd like to know it is still a valid work list:
The list he sent is as following:

> 1.  Write a paper in layman's terms that answers
> questions like the following:
> Benefits of auctioning online for both buyers and
> sellers, particularly in reverse auctions
> Explanation how multi-variable auctions are not
> as efficient as price-only auctions (is this true?)
> How many participants are recommended for a
> successful live auction
> What types of goods and services are best suited
> for live auctions versus sealed bid quotes
> Opinions on lotting strategies
> Trends in online private auctions

> 2.  Identify appropriate recent auction research (3
> or 4 papers out of the 90+ you provided)and obtain approvals from the
> authors to post on our site

> 3. Create a list/bibiliography of relevant auction
> literature (with hyperlinks?)

> 4.  Would you be willing to offer auction consulting
> services to our customers (if they are interested)

Third:
There is an e-procurement forum at Haas School of business,
in May 22. The chair of the forum is my advisor Prof. Arie Segev.
A person from Wells Fargo Bank will talk about Wells Fargo's role
in e-marketplace payment initiative,
where ENRON broadband services is also one of key players
along with Citibank.
He asked me whether you can contact a person at
ENRON broadband services, who's related to the initiative.
He wants to know whether we will have a speaker from ENRON
to see ENRON's perspective, in the Forum.

Here is a link to news related to the initiative,

http://www.internetweek.com/story/INW20000808S0001

Fourth:
My advisor wants to know whether
there could be any opportunity to do a case study,
regarding ENRON's business.
He is interested in e-procurement and e-marketplaces.
Business model and System architecture...

Thanks for reading this long email.
I'll look forward to your answer..
I am sorry for giving you so much burden
to answer those questions possibly not easy to answer.

Warm regards,
Jinbaek

"Ray,
 Commissioner Hebert may have been more accurate than he supposed in his 
""Freudian slip"". The contingency reserve standard in WSCC is the greater of 
the largest single contingency or of a quantity equal to the sum of 5% times 
the load portion served by hydro plus 7% for the load portion served by 
thermal units.  For 1000 MW served half by hydro and half by thermal, the 
contingency reserve would be 60 MW (500 MW *.05 + 500 MW * .07) for a total 
of 6%.  As a result, Hebert could be right that price mitigation would be in 
place all the time, although I don't think that was what was intended.  

 Even if you are meeting the WSCC standard pre-contingency in an all thermal 
system (7% reserve standard), every time a unit trips off line the reserve at 
that point drops below 7% until more generation comes on line.  Did the FERC 
mean to include this contingency recovery period as ""any time the reserve is 
below 7%?""   These are among the problems we are proposing to address in our 
comments to FERC on the order.

		 Subject: House and Senate Energy Hearings Today on California/Western 
Electric Situation

I was at the Senate hearing today on FERC's market Monitoring and Mitigation 
order, and I would add only a few additional and interesting 
regulatory-related details to John's fine summary:

The hearing was contentious- among the Senators themselves, among the FERC 
Commissioners themselves, and the interchanges between them.

Gas prices were controversial.  Commissioner Massey kicked off the discussion 
on this issue citing a transport basis differential into CA of $10, when it 
was less than a dollar in other areas.  He then noted that the high gas cost 
would adversely affect the power price under the auction, and that FERC must 
act regarding the high transport differentials- ""We will never get a handle 
on electric prices unless we get a handle on gas prices"".  That opened the 
floodgates of discussion, culminating with the announcement by Commissioner 
Breathitt of FERC's technical conference (notice of which issued today) on 
the topic of current and projected interstate pipeline capacity, and adequacy 
of infrastructure within CA.  She said that this would shed light on basis 
differentials and gas prices.

Freudian slip?  Chairman Hebert was heard to say by various attendees that 
price mitigation in the WSCC would apply at all times (in contrast to the 
order, which proposes mitigation only during times when reserves reach/fall 
below 7%).  Whether he mis-spoke, or not, remains to be seen.  

Regarding the issue of how often mitigation would be invoked in CA (i.e., 
Stages 1, 2 or 3):
 Hebert opined ""Most of the time"".
 Breathitt said ""Likely 80-85% of the time"".
 Massey was unconvinced.

Several Senators railed at the Commission for ""not doing its job"" and 
threatened that if the Commission did not act, Congress would act.

If you have any questions or need additional detail, please feel free to 
call.  Ray

Subject: House and Senate Energy Hearings Today on California/Western 
Electric Situation

I attended both the House and Senate energy committee hearings today.  House 
hearing was in the Barton Subcommittee (Energy & Air Quality).  Senate 
hearing was on last week's FERC order on a ""soft price cap"" and related 
issues.  The House witnesses were dominated by California officials: Cal 
Energy Commission, Cal Air Resources Board, Chairman of Gov Davis Generation 
Implementation Task Force.  In addition, there were witnesses from the 
Western Area Power Admin and Bonneville PA.  The Senate witnesses were the 
three FERC commissioners.

HIghlights

Chairman Barton said it is still his intention to try to mark up the Barton 
bill, H.R. 1647 next week (many on and off the Subcommittee doubt this will 
happen; we are gathering political intelligence on those prospects and will 
report back with more information and conclusions once that is done); 
Chairman Barton also said he may go to California next week.
There was considerable emphasis at both hearings about the alleged role that 
higher natural gas prices into California play in the electric power rate 
increases; several witnesses focused on difference in alleged transportation 
costs for similar differences between California and non-CA states; FERC at 
the Senate hearing said that today the commission announced a staff technical 
conference for later this month on all aspects of the natural gas market as 
it relates to California; a House member from Southern Illinois coal country 
attacked California for using only natural gas in its new power plants.
The House witnesses, primarily BPA but also the California witnesses, 
attacked the negawatt provision in sec. 102 of the Barton bill; the criticism 
was that BPA would be forced to purchase power on the open market at a high 
price since it is short, sell it to the DSIs under contract; let the DSI sell 
it at market rates and capture the difference; BPA witness said that thus 
sec. 102 would make it difficult if not impossible to implement their 
strategy to avoid as much as a 200 percent rate increase on 10/1/01; BPA 
testimony will make it tough for Members of Congress from that service region 
to support sec. 102.
Both hearings also touched on how difficult it would be to actually devise a 
price cap; at the House hearing, none of those advocating a price cap among 
the witnesses could answer excellent questions about exactly how this could 
be done; the witnesses just said ""cost plus a reasonable profit"" and said 
leave the details to FERC; at afternoon Senate hearing, Chairman Hebert had 
the staff bring in 15 boxes from one FP&L case to show how a price cap would 
take too long to bring any relief to California this summer; he said last 
week's soft price cap is much better.
Also on the price cap, Rep. Walden (R-OR)  got the Cal Energy Comm chair to 
admit that if the price caps had been in place earlier, California would NOT 
have taken the conservation and new generation steps that it has taken 
recently. 
The interplay among the FERC commissioners was much more contentious than it 
was a House hearing on Tuesday, although it could have been worse; when 
Senate Chairman Murkowski (R-AK) said that ""help is on the way"" in the form 
of the nominees for the two vacancies, Sen. Dorgan (D-ND) made a comment that 
suggested that the confirmation process will not be smooth; the same concern 
came from the interplay among the Senators, which was also somewhat 
contentious at times.

Please advise if you have any questions or would like further details.

Mike Day, 

I have asked my assistant to set up a conference call for this evening to 
discuss preserving our argments and rights of appeal, both generally and 
specifically (with respect to the negative CTC issue),  during and after the 
present hearing.  I know that we covered some of this in our previous call, 
and that a record on due process is being made, but I'd like for all of us to 
explore whether there is anything else we should be doing now, and what, if 
anything, we will need to do after the proceeding is concluded.  I will see 
if Larry Mollman from Brobeck can join us as well for the state court 
litigation perspective.  Stephanie will circulate the call-in information.  
Thanks.

NATURAL GAS REPORT--RESIDENTIAL GAS COSTS RISING
Residential costs for gas will rise this winter as the wholesale cost of
natural gas has doubled since last year. Local distribution companies
will feel opposing pressures of reducing the impact on customers,
while recouping their costs.

* This is not a one-year phenomenon. Wholesale prices are expected
to remain high through 2003.

* Rising gas prices were previously overshadowed by high heating
oil costs, but the spotlight will soon turn to gas as residential prices
could rise by 50 percent or more.

"I have no major changes, but Arctic air mass plunging into Plains now on
short range models.

Overall, the progression of ideas from last week look to hold true for this
week and beyond. The very cold weather will probably be a bit more expansive
by the end of the week than I had originally planned for, which means colder
for Texas, the Tennessee Valley, the Midwest and Ohio Valley later this
week. The deep Southeast and along the East coast it will turn colder later
this week but the coldest of air will not reach those areas.

Snow and ice will probably reach as far south as Oklahoma City in the Plains
and western PJM in the East during mid to late week. Houston may have
trouble getting out of the 40s for highs Thursday as compared to near 80
degree temps currently. A large area of snowcover will become established
over the next 5-10 days over the northern and central U.S.

I continue to believe the models look too warm in the long range, especially
in Canada. Once Canada gets cold at this time of year, it will likely stay
very cold. This will set the stage for additional cold air to spread across
the United States east of the Rockies in the long range.

Bottom line - true Winter is about to begin, the bear show is over.

"From one of the ARM members below. Our latest info is that there are still 3 
votes in SUPPORT of direct access. So, this measure would fail if that 
SUPPORT stays in place.  ARM and others plan a campaign to attack this draft 
decision.

From Commonwealth:
I have that Linda Serizawa, Commissioner Wood's advisor, has stated that
Commissioner Wood is at this moment drafting the decision on direct access.
She indicated that a draft order would be released, but would not say when.
She stated that ABX1-1 directed the CPUC to set a date at which time a
customer would no longer have the right to switch to an ESP, and indicated
that this order, as it is currently drafted, establishes that date.
Apparently there was great hesitant when making the statement ""as it is
presently drafted,"" indicating to that Wood is getting a lot of pressure not
to set the date.

because it is comprehensive and recommends many of the changes and solutions 
that Enron has been advocating for years.  The report is also encouraging 
because it indicates a significant level of understanding of the northeast 
markets (and the problems in these markets) by the FERC people who worked on 
this report.  Because this is only a brief summary, the entire report 
(particularly sections 4 and 5) should be read in detail.  A copy of the

Holden,

  Can you (Mark or Tom) provide any off-the-top-of-your-head information about El Paso?  Marina is doing a project in school and had the following question:

Virginia,

I am doing homework now, and I need your help. For my finance class, we are 
investing for real a 1 million $ in the stock market, my sector is Energy 
and I am doing a recommendation on Thursday this week. I am trying to decide 
between 2 stocks: one is El Paso Corp, the other one is Philips Petroleum. I 
know we do business with El Paso. Any valuable info that you can provide me 
with will be a great help (i.e. are they a good customer, how are they doing 
in your opinion, that type of info).
Sorry to bother you with this but it is really important. I will be making 
my presentation in front of the Trustees of the fund.

Thanks,

Marina"

Dear Judge Biren:

Pursuant to your instructions regarding procedures for serving testimony and

preparing exhibits, I submit the following information on behalf of Long
Beach.

a,  List of exhibits

    Long Beach intends to offer two exhibits:  Ex. 200, the prepared direct

testimony   of Elizabeth Wright, and Ex. 201, the prepared rebuttal
testimony
of  Elizabeth Wright.

b.  estimate of direct and cross-examination time

    Long Beach estimates only a few minutes of direct examination.

    Regarding cross-examination, Long Beach's estimates are necessarily
preliminary and incomplete (apparently I did not receive all of the direct
testimony) in light of the recent filing of rebuttal testimony.  Current
estimates   are as follows:

    Ladd Lorenz, SoCalGas - 4 hr.
    Eric Nelson, SoCalGas - 2 hr.
    R. Thomas Beach, various parties - 2 hr.
    Paul Amirault, Wild Goose - 1/2 hour
    Jeffrey Dasovich, Enron - 1/2 hour
    John Burkholder, Western Hub Properties - 11/2 hour
    Florio/Weil/Yap, Turn, et al - 2 hours

There may be additional witnesses, depending on information at the

Sara,

Carol and Rod are working on the ISDA comparison for a potential ISDA between 
ENA and Reliant Energy Services, Inc.  Last week, Cregg Lancaster furnished 
Reliant's newest form of Schedule and Paragraph 13 for our review.  You may 
want to visit with Carol as to the status.

Also, it is my understanding that once we have the ISDA between ENA and 
Reliant in place, that that form of agreement would be used for the ECC and 
Reliant Canada agreement (with the exception of the provisions specific to 
Canadian entities).

Hope this explanation help.

"Assuming that our bid's stay in the range discussed previously, what are we going to do? 

I am not going to hard trade the buyers at this point until we know for sure Suncor is there.. 

So, can you pls advise. 

I would suggest we get Suncor to give you a ""Stand Still"" for the rest of this week which includes a firm number ( or better ) that they will sell capacity for. By the way, this number needs to be close to zero as there is not much left over.


Current economics.... approx $400,000 Bid on the table, plus ENA holds option Apr 02 - oct 02 to put capacity to buyer.  Under this structre Suncor keeps capacity until Apr. 02. There are no liquids conversations being conducted at this time and pending structure may not be.

Dear Mr.Viverito

Thank you very much.
Now we start checking your draft and maybe we can return comment on this
Friday.

Please be advised following points at this time.
1)Part 6 on the schedule is needed to be deleted.
  We think that it's enough if the terms in Part 6 are referred in the
individual confirmation.
2)ISDA Credit support annex is not acceptable
  Unfortunately, we don't have internal system for concluding CSA with
non-financial entity.

Please keep support us for concluding ISDA ASAP for our business in near
future.
If any question, please feel free to contact me.

hi sara -- hope you had a good time in louisiana over the weekend!

i managed to lose my voice so i can only communicate by email for the time 
being.  could you confirm that you have no changes to the enron agreement or 
send me a mark-up?  if you want to give the changes to me verbally, i could 
probably have a legal assistant help me ask you questions if i need to.  
please let me know.  

many thanks.

"The Enron Center Garage has opened.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new 
building and currently park in the Allen Center and Metropolitan garage are 
being offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the 
new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The 
cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is 
currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly 
employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to 
the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made 
as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Sky Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be 
opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street 
level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Sky Ring access is 
available. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be 
used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to 
Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your 
email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and 
receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new 
garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and 
Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You may enter & exit on Clay St. and Bell St., also pedestrians, will have 
to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

Please respond via e-mail if you are interested in acquiring one of these 
spaces."

The nominations are due by April 29th at 2:00 P.M.  Also you need to know
that on May 7th through May 9th, TXU LSP will be replacing a piece of our
Line X Pipeline just to the east of the Ponderosa plant.  This means that
what gas you bring in from West Texas will have to match pretty much what
you burn.  Since this part of the pipeline will be cut off from the rest of
the pipeline there will be no way to handle swings in usage on the pipeline
during this time period.

I you have any questions please give me a call at 214-875-5185.

" Dear Ken,

 As you know our first meeting will be on Tuesday, May 23 at 4:30
p.m.  Pete Peterson, chairman of the Blackstone Group, has kindly agreed to
host it in his conference room. The address is:

 The Blackstone Group
 345 Park Avenue (between 51st and 52nd)
 31st floor

 I know that some plans have changed since we first set the meeting,
with some people being away and others having cancelled trips, so could you
please reconfirm whether or not you will be able to attend?

 Sometime next week, we will be sending you an agenda and a
background paper that focuses on the issues we propose to discuss. I greatly
appreciate all the help members of the panel have given Tim Koller and me.
As you know, Tim Koller is the McKinsey&Co. partner who kindly prepared the
draft outline we originally sent around.  He will also be preparing the
paper you will receive shortly.

 I am attaching the final list of panel members. Please do look it
over. There are some significant additions: Kenneth Lay of Enron, Rob Glaser
of RealNetworks, Len Baker of Sutter Hill Ventures,  Dennis Powell of Cisco.


 I look forward to your rsvp, and hopefully to seeing you on May 23.

 Best regards,
 Jeff

"I'm glad you found something interesting to do. Let me know if you meet 
anybody famous!

We now have televisions in the elevators.  At first, CNN ran all the time.  
This morning we started getting messages from management about the SAP 
program.  It is kind of odd to get into an empty elevator, but hear voices.  

I was discussing Enron with my 20 year old daughter.  I found it difficult to 
summarize what Enron does, and what kind of opportunities it has for college 
grads.  Any wisdom you have on the subject would be appreciated.

I know your husband must be overjoyed to have you back.  His gain is our 
loss, but I understand completely.

Take care and keep in touch,

Kay
